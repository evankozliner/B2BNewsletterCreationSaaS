PLACEHOLDER IMAGE NEEDED:
========================

Filename: calendar-event-button-example.png

What to create:
- Screenshot of a calendar email invite (Gmail or Outlook)
- Show the calendar event details
- Highlight/circle/arrow pointing to the "Yes/I know the sender" button
- Or show where users should click to confirm the event

Recommended dimensions: 600-800px wide
Format: PNG or JPG
Location: Root directory of site (same folder as almost-done.html)

For now, you can:
1. Take a screenshot of a real calendar invite you send
2. Add an arrow or circle highlighting the confirmation button
3. Save as calendar-event-button-example.png
4. Replace the current placeholder

Until then, the image will show as broken on almost-done.html
