                            <p>Bechtle AVS, an IT integration services vendor, faced challenges with application development due to a lack of standardized tools and multiple dedicated environments tailored to different customers' needs. To address these issues, co-founder Andr√© Alfter implemented a platform engineering approach that provided developers with an all-in-one self-service portal to streamline development processes. This transition, facilitated by the vendor Humanitec, allowed the company to adopt best practices and enhance developer morale while enabling easier customization for clients. The internal developer platform has since simplified operations, standardized tools across the team, and is considered an evolving product in production.</p>

                            <p>Palo Alto Networks has completed the acquisition of QRadar for $500 million, facilitating the migration of IBM's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform users to Palo Alto's Cortex XSIAM platform. This transition aims to provide users with a more integrated and automated security operations framework, consolidating various functionalities such as data centralization and threat intelligence. Although Palo Alto Networks will offer ongoing support for on-premises QRadar users, the migration process typically takes around three months for those opting for the SaaS version, with qualified customers receiving complimentary support. This acquisition illustrates the ongoing consolidation trend in the security market, as companies seek to develop larger, more comprehensive solutions for security operations centers.</p>
