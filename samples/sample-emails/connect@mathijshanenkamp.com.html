                            <p>The Federal-style building on Greenwich Street serves as a poignant reminder of a past era, standing in contrast to the contemporary luxury condos surrounding it. A notable feature is a 1984 text painting by conceptual artist Lawrence Weiner, which encapsulates themes of loss and utility, referencing water's journey from source to usage. The legacies of Buczak and Hendricks, who contributed to the house's unique story, are preserved despite their passing, creating a monument to a bygone time in New York City. The interior reflects their shared life, embodying a history that risks fading from collective memory.</p>

                            <p>RMS Titanic Inc, the company with salvage rights to the wreck of the Titanic, completed its first expedition to the site since 2010, uncovering significant changes after over a century. Among the noteworthy discoveries was the bronze statue "Diana of Versailles," last seen in 1986, showcasing the siteâ€™s ongoing transformation. However, the expedition also revealed the deterioration of the iconic bow railing, which had remained intact until 2022, highlighting a bittersweet mix of preservation and loss. The expedition captured over 2 million high-resolution images and fully mapped the wreck site to aid future recovery efforts and enhance scientific understanding.</p>

                            <p>A 17th century painting titled "Portrait of a Girl" by Rembrandt was discovered in an attic in Camden, Maine, selling for $1.4 million at auction. Art appraiser Kaja Veilleux found the portrait amid various art pieces, with a label indicating it had been loaned to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for a 1970 exhibition.
