                        <p>Google is facing new antitrust problems in the U.K. as the competition watchdog suspects the tech giant of abusing its dominance in the advertising technology, or adtech, industry. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating since May 2022 and has sent formal objections to Google based on preliminary findings that its practices harm U.K. publishers and advertisers. If Google is found guilty, it could face fines up to 10% of its global revenue.<br/><br/>The CMA alleges that since at least 2015, Google has unfairly favored its own ad exchange, AdX, over competitors. This includes giving AdX preferential access to advertisers and manipulating bids to disadvantage other exchanges. The CMA is now considering what actions to take to ensure Google stops these anti-competitive practices, which could include structural remedies like selling parts of its adtech business. Google has rejected the CMA's claims and plans to respond. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is also pursuing an antitrust case against Google for similar reasons.</p>

                    <p>A powerful storm hit the East Coast recently, causing major problems. Thunderstorms, heavy rain, and strong winds led to widespread flooding. More than 20 states declared emergencies. In South Carolina, vehicles floated away, and streets turned into rivers. In North Carolina, the storm caused heavy damage, including fallen trees that blocked roads.   Thousands of people lost power as the storm raged on, with over 300,000 customers affected. Officials warned about possible flash floods and landslides, urging people to stay indoors. Emergency services were on high alert, ready to help those in need. As the storm moves out, recovery efforts will begin soon.</p>

                        <h3>Perchlorate Contamination Found in Common Food Products, Including Mac and Cheese</h3>

                        <p>Perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel, is also sneaking into our food, including mac and cheese. According to experts, it can contaminate our meals through polluted water for crops and from plastic storage containers.   Consumer Reports found perchlorate in two-thirds of their food samples. The highest amounts were in baby and kids' foods, fast food, and fresh fruits and veggies. Boxed mac and cheese also had traces of this chemical.   While no single serving has been found to exceed safety limits, kids eating multiple servings could face higher risks. Perchlorate may disrupt thyroid function and affect children's brain development and growth.   Experts suggest a balanced diet to reduce risks, and foods rich in iodine, like seafood and dairy, can help counteract perchlorate's effects.</p>

                    <h3>CICC Announces Pay Cuts and Job Reassignments Amid Market Downturn</h3>

                    <p>China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a big investment bank, has announced pay cuts for its workers due to a downturn in the capital market. Those affected are being asked to accept lower positions and salaries. Employees who agree can sign new contracts, while those who refuse have the option to resign.   Recently, CICC's stock fell by 4.3%. They had already reduced their workforce by laying off a third of their investment banking staff earlier this year. By June 30, they employed about 15,000 people, down from over 15,300. CICC's profits have also declined, with a 37% drop in net profit compared to last year. This isn't just CICC; many investment firms in China are facing similar challenges and downsizing.</p>
