                        <p>Most people dislike how their job performance is managed. Studies show that performance management systems are even less liked than cable companies or health insurance. However, making some simple changes can improve satisfaction and results. <br><br> Happy employees are 1.4 times more likely to hit their financial targets, 3 times better at managing change, 3.2 times more likely to take risks, and twice as likely to innovate. To make performance management work better, focus on fairness, clear goals, ongoing feedback, and recognizing good work.      </p>

                        <h3>What Is Continuous Performance Management?</h3>

                        <p>Workplaces are changing for the better, with teams working faster and more closely together. This shift means we need to rethink how we manage and grow careers. Traditional annual reviews are outdated, so it's time to explore new ways to keep performance management ongoing and effective.<br><br> Continuous performance management is a modern approach that focuses on regular feedback and growth. It encourages employees to support each other and fosters a culture where feedback is frequent and constructive. This method improves communication, helps set goals, and builds trust within teams.<br><br> Using tools like regular check-ins and crowdsourced feedback, companies can see big benefits. Employees are more engaged, with those receiving daily feedback being three times more engaged. This approach also reduces turnover risk by nearly 15% and boosts overall productivity by 5-10%.<br><br> Real-world examples show that continuous performance management leads to higher employee retention and satisfaction. Companies that embrace this method see improved performance and stronger connections to their business goals. It's clear that ongoing feedback is a game changer for modern workplaces.</p>

                    <h3>The rise of the 'hushed hybrid' workplace</h3>

                    <p>Imagine starting a new job with a rule that says you must work in the office every day. But then, you see some coworkers working from home a few days each week, even though the official policy says otherwise. This is becoming known as the "hushed hybrid" workplace.<br><br>  In the UK, a survey shows that 70% of managers let their team work from home, even if the company says no. Many workers prefer flexible work options over a pay raise, and about 4 million UK workers have changed jobs because of this need. However, when some employees get more flexibility than others, it can lead to feelings of unfairness and low morale.<br><br>  When workers see that others are allowed to work remotely, they might feel left out or treated unfairly. This can cause frustration, make employees unhappy, and even lead to them leaving the company. Managers need to handle these situations carefully to avoid problems and ensure everyone feels treated equally.<br><br>  Managers who let some employees work from home while others cannot might face serious issues. It’s crucial for companies to clearly communicate their policies and consider flexible work options for everyone, especially those with special needs or personal responsibilities. This helps create a fair and supportive work environment.</p>

                    <p>Seven West Media recently faced criticism for a performance by “sexy Santas” at a staff meeting. The dancers, dressed in short skirts, performed to a Mariah Carey song, which some attendees found “cringe-worthy.” This comes amid allegations of a toxic work culture at the company.<br><br>  The event was meant to be a festive presentation, not a typical meeting. Sarah-Jane Tasker, who was recently promoted as the first female editor of the West Australian, felt the reaction was exaggerated and not reflective of the workplace culture she values.</p>
