                            <h3>Influencers Weigh Risks of Disabling Social Media Comments</h3>

                            <p>Research from the University of Alabama and Vanderbilt University reveals that influencers who disable comments on their social media posts experience a backlash from viewers, who perceive them as less likable and less trustworthy. The study, published in the Journal of Marketing, indicates that when influencers suppress comments, it alienates their audience and diminishes engagement with promoted products. Experiments conducted on platforms like X and Instagram showed that viewers often feel that disabled comments reflect a lack of care about user feedback, leading to significant negative perceptions of influencers. While influencers may disable comments to protect their mental health, viewers may expect strong justifications and hold different standards based on the influencer's identity and situation.</p>
