                    Aimply bills per hour and on attributable growth or sales on a
                    case-by-case basis. Low-skill services like video posting are 15$
                    per hour. For any content we generate, we also charge based on
                    growth and sales (in the 10-20% range) as well as an hourly base fee
                    depending on the type of content being generated.

                <p class="a">
                    1. Research assistance: This can either be through our automated
                    tools, or from a dedicated virtual assistant with a bachelor's
                    degree.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. Video editing and posting: We can edit short or long form videos
                    to add effects, B-roll, photos, etc. We also cut long form content
                    to short form content for platforms like Tiktok. We're also happy to
                    post videos onto platforms manually to avoid penalties for
                    auto-posted content.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. AI content generation: We can generate tweets, blog posts,
                    ebooks, all in your voice and tone. All content is generated based
                    off your already-existing content; e.g. we can generate tweets using
                    what you've said in your Youtube videos. We do not try to create
                    "novel" content with AI.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. Community management: We can manage and set up Discord servers,
                    Patreon accounts. We can act as moderators and handle responding to
                    subscriber's questions. We'll remind your subscribers of your Q&As,
                    keep your Discord "warm", and much more.

                <p class="a">
                    Hiring within your community can be great, but oftentimes it leads
                    to working with less experienced employees who need rehired or let
                    go frequently due to low hours and lack of upward mobility. At
                    Aimply we work to ensure even our most junior employees have
                    experienced supervision and appropriate weekly hours; this increases
                    quality and reduces churn.

                    management. Because we have such a holistic view of your content and
                    your community, we can produce higher quality work.

                    content is quality assure, edited by our team, and approved by the
                    creators it is posted on behalf of, so you can be sure it won't
