                    <div class="post-body">
                        <p>When Jacob Statler, founder of <a href="https://statdigital.io/">Stat Digital</a>, found us, he had a challenge many marketing agency owners can relate to:</p>
<p>Jacob crushed marketing for clients but couldn&#39;t find time to market his own agency. He was WELL aware of the irony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d spend all week creating quality content for clients. Then Friday would come around, and I&#39;d tell myself I&#39;d start my own newsletter next week. That went on for a year.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>8 months since starting with Potions, that story looks completely different.</p>
<p>With Potions, Jacob launched <strong>Content Detox</strong>, a weekly newsletter that now reaches 650+ subscribers, saves him 30+ hours a month, and consistently fuels new client conversations and project expansions.</p>
<p>The best part? Stat Digital is now nurturing every lead that&#39;s ever been in the pipeline — without adding extra workload. Here&#39;s how it happened.</p>
<h2 id="section-0">Client Snapshot</h2>
<table class="table-left-narrow"><thead><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Client</strong></td><td>Stat Digital</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Industry</strong></td><td>B2B Marketing Agency</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Key Results</h3>
<table class="table-left-narrow"><thead><th>Metric</th><th>Result</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>650+</td></tr><tr><td>Weekly LinkedIn readers</td><td>140+</td></tr><tr><td>Hours saved per month</td><td>30+</td></tr><tr><td>Client contract expansions</td><td>✓ (5-figure ARRs)</td></tr><tr><td>Average open rate</td><td>40.9%</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="section-1">The Story of an Agency Marketer Who Struggled with Consistency for His Own Marketing</h2>
<p>Stat Digital helps early-stage B2B SaaS companies build predictable growth through exceptional content and SEO. But like so many service-based founders, Jacob&#39;s own marketing always fell to the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>He mainly relied on posting 3 to 5 times a week on LinkedIn, a strategy that built visibility but consumed 8+ hours every week and was subject to the whims of the algorithm gods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, promising leads in his CRM sat idle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d have great sales calls, and then months would go by before I followed up. Those relationships went cold, that&#39;s thousands of dollars left on the table.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a newsletter was an obvious need, but that meant an extra 6-8 hours a week if he did all the research, writing, and designing, and also handled delivery himself.</p>
<h3>The Cost of DIY</h3>
<p>Before finding Potions, Jacob was considering shelling out roughly $1,000 a month to pay for this newsletter stack:</p>
<table class="table-left-narrow"><thead><th>Item</th><th>Monthly Cost</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Freelance writer</td><td>$869</td></tr><tr><td>beehiiv</td><td>$49</td></tr><tr><td>Zapier</td><td>$29.99</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>$947.99</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>And even then, he&#39;d have to edit everything to really make it his own.</p>
<p>&quot;Just use AI&quot; wasn&#39;t the answer either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Even though ChatGPT would save me time writing, I was still left to stitch together the entire newsletter process by myself. Every. Single. Week.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means thing like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segmenting his list (and sunsetting old subscribers)</li>
<li>Building re-engagement campaigns, welcome emails, and launch campaigns</li>
<li>Testing the design across email clients</li>
<li>Researching the news sources he actually trusts (and not just whatever garbage sources ChatGPT would cite)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacob needed a newsletter system that kept his tone and strategy intact, without draining his time and energy.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Why a Marketing Agency Made a No-Brainer Decision to Choose Potions</h2>
<p>When Jacob found Potions while researching AI startups, he immediately understood what made us different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Potions wasn&#39;t another platform like Mailchimp or beehiiv. It actually ran your newsletter for you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That distinction was key. Our done-for-you model meant he could hand over setup, deliverability, and writing, all while maintaining full creative control and for a fraction of the cost of hiring a team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was a total no-brainer. Potions eliminated everything I didn&#39;t want to deal with — setup, deliverability, content creation, all of it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/Content%20Detox%20Content%20Based%20Networking%20examples.png" alt="Statler Website"></p>
<p>2 weeks later, <strong>Content Detox</strong> was live (see a sample of it on our <a href="https://withpotions.com/samples.html">samples page</a>).</p>
<h2 id="section-3">The Always-On Newsletter That Effortlessly Saves 30+ Hours Every Month</h2>
<p>We kicked off the launch of Content Detox by interviewing Jacob to capture his voice and ideal audience. From there, we built a custom newsletter template that looked and read like Stat Digital: smart, witty, and strategic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was really impressive how quickly they got things moving. The whole process runs like a sewing machine.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each week, our AI and team curate stories relevant to B2B marketers, draft the issue, and send it to Jacob for approval. He spends just <strong>30 minutes</strong> adding his expert insights to Potions and another <strong>45 minutes</strong> putting his unique touch on each newsletter. A far cry from the 6-8 hours it would take on his own.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a savings of <strong>26-35 hours every month</strong>, almost a full workweek to focus on clients and growing his own agency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Potions doesn&#39;t just save time. It gives me peace of mind knowing my audience hears from me every week, even during my busiest client weeks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also connect directly with Jacob via Slack for fast collaboration, sharing link ideas, feedback, and scheduling updates in real time.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">From Sporadic Posts to a Scalable Content Engine that Fuels Pipeline</h2>
<p>8 months after launch, the Content Detox newsletter has become one of Stat Digital&#39;s most reliable marketing channels, producing measurable growth and consistent engagement.</p>
<p>Leads and clients now mention the newsletter on calls. Old leads re-engage on their own. And existing clients have expanded their own scope of work after reading the newsletter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s been nice to have something consistent that goes out every week. People I&#39;ve talked to before will reply or comment on something from the newsletter, and that keeps me in the conversation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>8 Months After Launching Content Detox:</h3>
<table class="table-left-narrow"><thead><th>Metric</th><th>Result</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average open rate</td><td>40.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>650+ and growing</td></tr><tr><td>Weekly LinkedIn readers</td><td>140+</td></tr><tr><td>Hours saved monthly</td><td>30+</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue impact</td><td>Expanded 5-figure ARR client contracts</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src="https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/8_month_results.png" alt="8 Month Results"></p>
<h3>Content Repurposing Flywheel</h3>
<p>Each edition fuels Jacob&#39;s broader content flywheel. He repurposes sections of Content Detox into LinkedIn posts, in about 10 minutes, keeping his feed active and relevant without adding more to his schedule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s nice that I can reuse parts of it. It helps me show up more often without feeling like I have to constantly come up with something new.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob also leverages Content Detox as a content-based networking play, where he interviews industry experts and features their insights as the main story.</p>
<p><img src="https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/Content%20Detox%20Sample.png" alt="Content Detox Sample.png"></p>
<p>This has become a way to </p>
<ol>
<li>Grow subscribers.</li>
<li>Build connections that could turn into referral sources or future clients.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">The Unexpected Impact: From Stress to Strategy</h2>
<p>Beyond the metrics, Jacob gained something even more valuable: a sense of ease and control that transformed his marketing from a source of stress into a system that works.</p>
<p>Even experienced marketers struggle to find time for their own marketing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Before Potions, I was on a hamster wheel trying to stay consistent on social and follow up with leads. Now, my marketing runs on autopilot.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That shift, from guilt to calm, became one of his biggest wins. The impact of reclaiming headspace caught Jacob by surprise.</p>
<p>Now, instead of scrambling to write posts, he knows a polished newsletter will reach his audience every week, whether he&#39;s heads-down on client work or out of the office.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been able to treat my own agency like one of my clients. That&#39;s the biggest change.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Potions flipped what used to be a nagging to-do into a strategic system that compounds over time, serving as an always-on channel for credibility, thought leadership, and new business.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Jacob&#39;s Advice for Those Considering Potions</h2>
<p><strong>Potions is a low-risk, low-cost, high-value investment</strong> compared to DIY-ing it or hiring a team.</p>
<p>Traditional newsletter platforms still leave you managing content, design, and deliverability on your own, which requires hours of work. And we all know, time is money.</p>
<p>With Potions, most of the work is done for you. Even if you&#39;re like Jacob, who proudly admits he&#39;s extra picky about content quality, he only spends less than an hour fine-tuning each issue.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a cost-effective, hassle-free way to launch a professional newsletter without adding to your workload.</p>
<p><img src="https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/bot.png" alt="Content Detox Sample.png"></p>
