When Jacob Statler, founder of [Stat Digital](https://statdigital.io/), found us, he had a challenge many marketing agency owners can relate to:

Jacob crushed marketing for clients but couldn't find time to market his own agency. He was WELL aware of the irony.

> "I'd spend all week creating quality content for clients. Then Friday would come around, and I'd tell myself I'd start my own newsletter next week. That went on for a year."

8 months later, that story looks completely different.

With Potions, Jacob launched **Content Detox**, a weekly newsletter that now reaches 650+ subscribers, saves him 30+ hours a month, and consistently fuels new client conversations and project expansions.

The best part? Stat Digital is now nurturing every lead that's ever been in the pipeline — without adding extra workload. Here's how it happened.

## The Story of an Agency Marketer Who Struggled with Consistency for His Own Marketing

![Statler Website](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat_digital_site.png)

Stat Digital helps early-stage B2B SaaS companies build predictable growth through exceptional content and SEO. But like so many service-based founders, Jacob's own marketing always fell to the bottom of the list.

He mainly relied on posting 3 to 5 times a week on LinkedIn, a strategy that built visibility but consumed 8+ hours every week and was subject to the whims of the algorithm gods.

Meanwhile, promising leads in his CRM sat idle.

> "I'd have great sales calls, and then months would go by before I followed up. Those relationships went cold, that's thousands of dollars left on the table."

Creating a newsletter was an obvious need, but that meant an extra 6-8 hours a week if he did all the research, writing, and designing, and also handled delivery himself.

### The Cost of DIY

Before finding Potions, Jacob was considering shelling out roughly $1,000 a month to pay for this newsletter stack:

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Freelance writer | $869 |
| beehiiv | $49 |
| Zapier | $29.99 |
| **Total** | **$947.99** |

And even then, he'd have to edit everything to really make it his own.

"Just use AI" wasn't the answer either.

> "Even though ChatGPT would save me time writing, I was still left to stitch together the entire newsletter process by myself. Every. Single. Week."

Jacob needed a newsletter system that kept his tone and strategy intact, without draining his time and energy.

## Why a Marketing Agency Made a No-Brainer Decision to Choose Potions

When Jacob found Potions while researching AI startups, he immediately understood what made us different.

> "Potions wasn't another platform like Mailchimp or beehiiv. It actually ran your newsletter for you."

That distinction was key. Our done-for-you model meant he could hand over setup, deliverability, and writing, all while maintaining full creative control and for a fraction of the cost of hiring a team.

> "It was a total no-brainer. Potions eliminated everything I didn't want to deal with — setup, deliverability, content creation, all of it."

2 weeks later, **Content Detox** was live.

## The Always-On Newsletter That Effortlessly Saves 30+ Hours Every Month

We kicked off the launch of Content Detox by interviewing Jacob to capture his voice and ideal audience. From there, we built a custom newsletter template that looked and read like Stat Digital: smart, witty, and strategic.

> "It was really impressive how quickly they got things moving. The whole process runs like a sewing machine."

Each week, our AI and team curate stories relevant to B2B marketers, draft the issue, and send it to Jacob for approval. He spends just **30 minutes** adding his expert insights to Potions and another **45 minutes** putting his unique touch on each newsletter. A far cry from the 6-8 hours it would take on his own.

That's a savings of **26-35 hours every month**, almost a full workweek to focus on clients and growing his own agency.

> "Potions doesn't just save time. It gives me peace of mind knowing my audience hears from me every week, even during my busiest client weeks."

We also connect directly with Jacob via Slack for fast collaboration, sharing link ideas, feedback, and scheduling updates in real time.

## From Sporadic Posts to a Scalable Content Engine that Fuels Pipeline

8 months after launch, the Content Detox newsletter has become one of Stat Digital's most reliable marketing channels, producing measurable growth and consistent engagement.

Leads and clients now mention the newsletter on calls. Old leads re-engage on their own. And existing clients have expanded their own scope of work after reading the newsletter.

> "It's been nice to have something consistent that goes out every week. People I've talked to before will reply or comment on something from the newsletter, and that keeps me in the conversation."

### Content Repurposing Flywheel

Each edition fuels Jacob's broader content flywheel. He repurposes sections of Content Detox into LinkedIn posts, in about 10 minutes, keeping his feed active and relevant without adding more to his schedule.

> "It's nice that I can reuse parts of it. It helps me show up more often without feeling like I have to constantly come up with something new."

Jacob also leverages Content Detox as a content-based networking play, where he interviews industry experts and features their insights as the main story.

This has become a way to 1) grow subscribers and 2) build connections that could turn into referral sources or future clients.

## The Unexpected Impact: From Stress to Strategy

Beyond the metrics, Jacob gained something even more valuable: a sense of ease and control that transformed his marketing from a source of stress into a system that works.

Even experienced marketers struggle to find time for their own marketing.

> "Before Potions, I was on a hamster wheel trying to stay consistent on social and follow up with leads. Now, my marketing runs on autopilot."

That shift, from guilt to calm, became one of his biggest wins. The impact of reclaiming headspace caught Jacob by surprise.

Now, instead of scrambling to write posts, he knows a polished newsletter will reach his audience every week, whether he's heads-down on client work or out of the office.

> "It's the first time I've been able to treat my own agency like one of my clients. That's the biggest change."

Potions flipped what used to be a nagging to-do into a strategic system that compounds over time, serving as an always-on channel for credibility, thought leadership, and new business.

## Jacob's Advice for Those Considering Potions

**Potions is a low-risk, low-cost, high-value investment** compared to DIY-ing it or hiring a team.

Traditional newsletter platforms still leave you managing content, design, and deliverability on your own, which requires hours of work. And we all know, time is money.

With Potions, most of the work is done for you. Even if you're like Jacob, who proudly admits he's extra picky about content quality, he only spends less than an hour fine-tuning each issue.

It's a cost-effective, hassle-free way to launch a professional newsletter without adding to your workload.

## Ready To Finally Launch Your Newsletter?
