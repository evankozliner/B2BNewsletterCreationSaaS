        "content": "Understanding how your newsletter performs compared to industry benchmarks is crucial for measuring success and identifying opportunities for improvement. Here's what the data tells us about email marketing performance in 2025.\n\n## Industry Benchmark Overview\n\nEmail marketing performance varies significantly across industries. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of average metrics:\n\n| Industry | Average Open Rate | Average Click Rate | Average Conversion Rate |\n|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| B2B SaaS | 21.5% | 3.2% | 2.1% |\n| E-commerce | 18.2% | 2.8% | 1.8% |\n| Professional Services | 24.3% | 4.1% | 3.2% |\n| Healthcare | 22.8% | 3.5% | 2.4% |\n| Financial Services | 19.7% | 2.9% | 2.0% |\n| Technology | 20.1% | 3.0% | 1.9% |\n\n## What These Numbers Mean\n\n### Open Rates\n\nYour open rate is the percentage of recipients who opened your email. Factors that influence open rates include:\n\n- **Subject line quality:** Compelling, personalized subject lines perform better\n- **Sender name recognition:** Familiar sender names boost opens\n- **Send timing:** Tuesday-Thursday mornings typically perform best\n- **List hygiene:** Regular cleaning of inactive subscribers improves rates\n\n### Click Rates\n\nClick-through rate measures how many people clicked on links in your email:\n\n- **Content relevance:** Highly targeted content drives more clicks\n- **Call-to-action design:** Clear, prominent CTAs convert better\n- **Email length:** Shorter, focused emails often outperform long ones\n- **Mobile optimization:** Essential for reaching the 60%+ mobile readers\n\n### Conversion Rates\n\nThe ultimate metric—what percentage of recipients took your desired action:\n\n- **Landing page quality:** Seamless experience from email to landing page\n- **Offer strength:** Compelling value propositions drive conversions\n- **Personalization:** Tailored content converts significantly better\n- **Friction reduction:** Simplify the conversion process\n\n## Performance Comparison by List Size\n\nNewsletter performance also varies based on your subscriber count:\n\n| List Size | Average Open Rate | Average Click Rate | Average Unsubscribe Rate |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| < 1,000 | 26.8% | 4.5% | 0.3% |\n| 1,000 - 10,000 | 23.2% | 3.8% | 0.5% |\n| 10,000 - 50,000 | 21.1% | 3.2% | 0.6% |\n| 50,000+ | 18.9% | 2.7% | 0.8% |\n\nSmaller lists typically see higher engagement because they're often more targeted and personal. As lists grow, maintaining engagement becomes more challenging but not impossible.\n\n## Send Frequency Impact\n\nHow often you send matters significantly for performance:\n\n| Send Frequency | Engagement Score | Unsubscribe Rate | Revenue per Subscriber |\n|----------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Daily | Medium (62/100) | 1.2% | $0.18 |\n| 2-3x per week | High (84/100) | 0.6% | $0.31 |\n| Weekly | High (88/100) | 0.4% | $0.42 |\n| Bi-weekly | Medium (71/100) | 0.3% | $0.28 |\n| Monthly | Low (54/100) | 0.2% | $0.15 |\n\n**Sweet spot:** Weekly newsletters typically deliver the best balance of engagement and revenue without overwhelming subscribers.\n\n## How to Improve Your Metrics\n\nIf your numbers fall below these benchmarks, here are proven strategies to improve:\n\n### Boost Open Rates\n- A/B test subject lines regularly\n- Optimize send times for your audience\n- Clean your list quarterly\n- Personalize subject lines with recipient data\n\n### Increase Click Rates\n- Use clear, action-oriented CTAs\n- Include only 1-2 primary CTAs per email\n- Optimize for mobile viewing\n- Test different content formats\n\n### Drive Conversions\n- Ensure landing pages match email messaging\n- Reduce form fields to essentials\n- Create urgency with limited-time offers\n- Use social proof and testimonials\n\n## Let Potions Handle the Heavy Lifting\n\nConsistently hitting or exceeding these benchmarks requires ongoing testing, optimization, and expertise. Potions delivers:\n\n- **Above-average performance:** Our newsletters typically exceed industry benchmarks by 15-30%\n- **Professional writing:** Engaging content that drives clicks and conversions\n- **Optimization expertise:** Continuous A/B testing and improvement\n- **List management:** Keeping your subscribers engaged and active\n- **Analytics insights:** Clear reporting on what's working and what's not\n\nFocus on running your business while we ensure your newsletter drives real results.",

        "title": "How Stat Digital's Newsletter Cashed In on Neglected Leads",
        "slug": "stat-digital-case-study",
        "excerpt": "How Potions helped Stat Digital turn inconsistent marketing into a lead-generating weekly newsletter that brings in new business.",
        "content": "When Jacob Statler, founder of [Stat Digital](https://statdigital.io/), found us, he had a challenge many marketing agency owners can relate to:\n\nJacob crushed marketing for clients but couldn't find time to market his own agency. He was WELL aware of the irony.\n\n> \"I'd spend all week creating quality content for clients. Then Friday would come around, and I'd tell myself I'd start my own newsletter next week. That went on for a year.\"\n\n8 months later, that story looks completely different.\n\nWith Potions, Jacob launched **Content Detox**, a weekly newsletter that now reaches 650+ subscribers, saves him 30+ hours a month, and consistently fuels new client conversations and project expansions.\n\nThe best part? Stat Digital is now nurturing every lead that's ever been in the pipeline — without adding extra workload. Here's how it happened.\n\n## Client Snapshot\n\n| | |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Client** | Stat Digital |\n| **Industry** | B2B Marketing Agency |\n\n### Key Results\n\n| Metric | Result            |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Subscribers | 650+              |\n| Weekly LinkedIn readers | 140+              |\n| Hours saved per month | 30+               |\n| Client contract expansions | ✓ (5-figure ARRs) |\n| Average open rate | 40.9%             |\n\n## The Story of an Agency Marketer Who Struggled with Consistency for His Own Marketing\n\n![Statler Website](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat_digital_site.png)\n\nStat Digital helps early-stage B2B SaaS companies build predictable growth through exceptional content and SEO. But like so many service-based founders, Jacob's own marketing always fell to the bottom of the list.\n\nHe mainly relied on posting 3 to 5 times a week on LinkedIn, a strategy that built visibility but consumed 8+ hours every week and was subject to the whims of the algorithm gods.\n\nMeanwhile, promising leads in his CRM sat idle.\n\n> \"I'd have great sales calls, and then months would go by before I followed up. Those relationships went cold, that's thousands of dollars left on the table.\"\n\nCreating a newsletter was an obvious need, but that meant an extra 6-8 hours a week if he did all the research, writing, and designing, and also handled delivery himself.\n\n### The Cost of DIY\n\nBefore finding Potions, Jacob was considering shelling out roughly $1,000 a month to pay for this newsletter stack:\n\n| Item | Monthly Cost |\n|------|--------------|\n| Freelance writer | $869 |\n| beehiiv | $49 |\n| Zapier | $29.99 |\n| **Total** | **$947.99** |\n\nAnd even then, he'd have to edit everything to really make it his own.\n\n\"Just use AI\" wasn't the answer either.\n\n> \"Even though ChatGPT would save me time writing, I was still left to stitch together the entire newsletter process by myself. Every. Single. Week.\"\n\nJacob needed a newsletter system that kept his tone and strategy intact, without draining his time and energy.\n\n## Why a Marketing Agency Made a No-Brainer Decision to Choose Potions\n\nWhen Jacob found Potions while researching AI startups, he immediately understood what made us different.\n\n> \"Potions wasn't another platform like Mailchimp or beehiiv. It actually ran your newsletter for you.\"\n\nThat distinction was key. Our done-for-you model meant he could hand over setup, deliverability, and writing, all while maintaining full creative control and for a fraction of the cost of hiring a team.\n\n> \"It was a total no-brainer. Potions eliminated everything I didn't want to deal with — setup, deliverability, content creation, all of it.\"\n\n![Statler Website](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/statler_content_sample.png)\n\n2 weeks later, **Content Detox** was live.\n\n## The Always-On Newsletter That Effortlessly Saves 30+ Hours Every Month\n\nWe kicked off the launch of Content Detox by interviewing Jacob to capture his voice and ideal audience. From there, we built a custom newsletter template that looked and read like Stat Digital: smart, witty, and strategic.\n\n> \"It was really impressive how quickly they got things moving. The whole process runs like a sewing machine.\"\n\nEach week, our AI and team curate stories relevant to B2B marketers, draft the issue, and send it to Jacob for approval. He spends just **30 minutes** adding his expert insights to Potions and another **45 minutes** putting his unique touch on each newsletter. A far cry from the 6-8 hours it would take on his own.\n\nThat's a savings of **26-35 hours every month**, almost a full workweek to focus on clients and growing his own agency.\n\n> \"Potions doesn't just save time. It gives me peace of mind knowing my audience hears from me every week, even during my busiest client weeks.\"\n\nWe also connect directly with Jacob via Slack for fast collaboration, sharing link ideas, feedback, and scheduling updates in real time.\n\n## From Sporadic Posts to a Scalable Content Engine that Fuels Pipeline\n\n8 months after launch, the Content Detox newsletter has become one of Stat Digital's most reliable marketing channels, producing measurable growth and consistent engagement.\n\nLeads and clients now mention the newsletter on calls. Old leads re-engage on their own. And existing clients have expanded their own scope of work after reading the newsletter.\n\n> \"It's been nice to have something consistent that goes out every week. People I've talked to before will reply or comment on something from the newsletter, and that keeps me in the conversation.\"\n\n### 8 Months After Launching Content Detox:\n\n| Metric | Result                                 |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|\n| Average open rate | 40.9%                                  |\n| Subscribers | 650+ and growing                       |\n| Weekly LinkedIn readers | 140+                                   |\n| Hours saved monthly | 30+                                    |\n| Revenue impact | Expanded 5-figure ARR client contracts |\n\n![8 Month Results](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/8_months.png)\n\n### Content Repurposing Flywheel\n\nEach edition fuels Jacob's broader content flywheel. He repurposes sections of Content Detox into LinkedIn posts, in about 10 minutes, keeping his feed active and relevant without adding more to his schedule.\n\n> \"It's nice that I can reuse parts of it. It helps me show up more often without feeling like I have to constantly come up with something new.\"\n\nJacob also leverages Content Detox as a content-based networking play, where he interviews industry experts and features their insights as the main story.\n\n![8 Month Results](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/statler_content_sample.png)\n\nThis has become a way to 1) grow subscribers and 2) build connections that could turn into referral sources or future clients.\n\n## The Unexpected Impact: From Stress to Strategy\n\nBeyond the metrics, Jacob gained something even more valuable: a sense of ease and control that transformed his marketing from a source of stress into a system that works.\n\nEven experienced marketers struggle to find time for their own marketing.\n\n> \"Before Potions, I was on a hamster wheel trying to stay consistent on social and follow up with leads. Now, my marketing runs on autopilot.\"\n\nThat shift, from guilt to calm, became one of his biggest wins. The impact of reclaiming headspace caught Jacob by surprise.\n\nNow, instead of scrambling to write posts, he knows a polished newsletter will reach his audience every week, whether he's heads-down on client work or out of the office.\n\n> \"It's the first time I've been able to treat my own agency like one of my clients. That's the biggest change.\"\n\nPotions flipped what used to be a nagging to-do into a strategic system that compounds over time, serving as an always-on channel for credibility, thought leadership, and new business.\n\n## Jacob's Advice for Those Considering Potions\n\n**Potions is a low-risk, low-cost, high-value investment** compared to DIY-ing it or hiring a team.\n\nTraditional newsletter platforms still leave you managing content, design, and deliverability on your own, which requires hours of work. And we all know, time is money.\n\nWith Potions, most of the work is done for you. Even if you're like Jacob, who proudly admits he's extra picky about content quality, he only spends less than an hour fine-tuning each issue.\n\nIt's a cost-effective, hassle-free way to launch a professional newsletter without adding to your workload.\n\n## Ready To Finally Launch Your Newsletter?\n\nAt Potions, our goal is to make it effortless to stay top-of-mind with all the neglected leads in your CRM. We combine automation with human creativity to deliver newsletters that sound like you, look like you, and work for you.\n\nStat Digital's Content Detox shows what happens when you finally get out of your own way and let your marketing run itself.\n\n[Get a free newsletter sample →](https://dzlivd9t4eb.typeform.com/to/kMeO3tlp)",
