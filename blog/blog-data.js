        "excerpt": "Discover the best newsletter services for 2025 that help swamped business owners stay consistent, build credibility, and connect with clients, without losing time.",
        "content": "Between Potions and my personal projects, I've managed roughly 100 newsletters, grown my newsletter to 50k+ subs, and currently send 100k+ emails per week for customers.\n\nAlong the way, I've tested many platforms out there and worked directly with many of the tools on this list. Below, I share my take on the services I've personally used or managed, to help you decide which best fits your needs.\n\nFor clarification, I'm including newsletter platforms AND services (AKA agencies):\n\nNewsletter platforms like Substack or beehiiv give you the tools to create and send your own newsletter. They're usually affordable, flexible, and great if you want full creative control, but you're still on the hook for writing, design, and making sure your newsletters land in the primary inbox.\n\nOn the other hand, newsletter agencies take the pressure off you by doing the work for you, usually for a pretty penny (A LOT of pennies). They're a good option if you'd rather focus on running your business and you've got a budget to make that happen.\n\nEither can work, depending on the kind of help you need and can afford.\n\n## My Top Picks for the Best Newsletter Platforms:\n\n1. **Potions**: Best Newsletter Platform that Includes a Done-for-You Service\n2. **beehiiv**: Best for Media Companies\n3. **Substack**: Best Free Newsletter Platform for Cultural Writing\n4. **Medium**: Best for Reader Experience (But on The Decline)\n5. **Kit**: Dependable Option for Digital Sellers\n6. **MailerLite**: Best for Affordability\n7. **Constant Contact**: Best for Non-Profits & Ticket Sellers\n8. **HubSpot**: Best for All-In-One CRM & Marketing Automation\n9. **Mailchimp**: Most Recognizable\n10. **Moosend**: Best for Affordable Marketing Automation\n11. **Brevo**: Best for Multichannel Marketing\n\n## My Newsletter Agency Recommendations:\n\n12. **The Feed Media**: Best for Enterprise Newsletter Growth\n13. **Thrive Letter**: Best for Businesses That Want Both Growth & Newsletter Creation\n\n## 1. Potions: Best Newsletter Platform that Includes a Done-for-You Service\n\n[Potions](https://withpotions.com) is the only newsletter platform that blends AI automation and a creative human team to deliver a fully done-for-you newsletter service. Potions works best for consultants, agencies, SaaS, and B2B services instead of media publishers or creator-led brands.\n\nYou can use Potions as your newsletter platform or Potions will run your newsletter on the platform you choose. And if you're not sure which is best, we'll guide you on the best one for your business.\n\nWith Potions, you can choose which newsletter platform you want to use. Or we can help guide you to the right platform for your business.\n\n![approve_potions.gif](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/approve_potions.gif)\n\nWith most newsletter tools, you're stuck at one of two extremes: either you're creating all the content yourself and juggling technicals, or you're shelling out thousands each month for a done-for-you agency team.\n\nPotions bridges that gap. It gives you the simplicity of an automated platform and the polish of a professional writing and design team, at one-tenth the price of a traditional agency.\n\nThe results speak for themselves: Potions-powered newsletters achieve an average 42% + open rate and 5% click-through rate, far outperforming typical industry benchmarks.\n\nYou'll start with a strategy session and brand setup, where Potions builds a newsletter template tailored to your voice, design preferences, and goals. From there, the process runs itself. Potions drafts, designs, and sends your newsletter each week, you just review and approve. Most clients spend about 15 minutes a week keeping their newsletters running consistently.\n\n![Potions Slack Update.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Potions%20Slack%20Update.png)\n\nPotions also handles all the technical details behind the scenes to make sure every email follows best practices. This includes everything from sender setup, list cleaning, throttling, removing spam words, adding alt text, and more, so your emails land in the main inbox every send.\n\nYou'll even get monthly reports showing your warmest leads so you know precisely who to follow up with – perfect for B2B companies like [Stat Digital that use their newsletter to turn leads into sales convos](https://withpotions.com/blog/stat-digital-case-study.html).\n\nThis hybrid of automation and human craftsmanship means you get high-quality newsletters at software-level pricing without adding more work to your calendar.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Far cheaper than letting your business's lead list go cold and losing touch with them | Not for media companies that want to produce their own original content |\n| All-in-one solution: platform + writing + design + deliverability | Not a fit if your newsletter is your main business and primary revenue driver |\n| Consistent, high-quality newsletters written in your brand's voice | Not ideal for users seeking the cheapest or free newsletter option |\n| Saves 80–95% of the time you'd spend doing it yourself | |\n| Reports show your most engaged leads for easy sales follow-up | |\n| Highly affordable alternative to hiring an agency or a team of freelancers (only starts at $129/month paid annually) | |\n| Potions will help you choose and run the newsletter platform that fits your unique needs | |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Done-for-you newsletter management** – Potions writes, designs, & sends every newsletter.\n* **Hybrid platform & service** – Combines the power of a modern newsletter platform with a full-service content & strategy team that's always available in your Slack workspace.\n* **Custom newsletter template** – Your dedicated team builds a branded, reusable newsletter template aligned with your logo, colors, & tone of voice.\n* **Email optimization** – Potions will optimize your emails to follow best practices (like adding alt text and removing spam words) and continuously improve each newsletter.\n* **AI-assisted content creation** – Potions uses AI to interview you (or your team) & transform your insights into authentic, original newsletter content.\n* **Weekly newsletter drafts** – Receive polished drafts for review & approval every week to maintain a consistent send cadence.\n* **Factual accuracy & on-brand checks** – Every piece of content passes a 3-stage QA process for accuracy & alignment with your brand tone before being sent.\n* **Deliverability management** – Potions handles sender setup, domain warm-up, list cleaning, & compliance so your emails land in the main inbox, not spam.\n* **Lead scoring reports** – Get automatic reports of your most engaged subscribers so your sales or consulting team knows exactly who to follow up with.\n* **Monetization support** – Potions can help you monetize your newsletter through ads, sponsorships, or paid subscriptions when you're ready to scale.\n* **Integrations & flexibility** – Potions can run on your preferred platform (like beehiiv or Mailchimp) or host your newsletter directly on its own platform to simplify costs & workflows.\n* **List growth support** – Add engaged subscribers for $2 per lead, or run managed growth campaigns under the Power plan.\n\n### Pricing\n\n![Potions pricing.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Potions%20pricing.PNG)\n\nPotions offers flexible, affordable plans for weekly newsletters that scale with your audience.\n\nThe Starter plan starts at $129/month (paid annually) and offers custom banner and newsletter design. Higher tiers add features like lead enrichment, strategy calls, and managed list growth. Plans increase in price and features based on subscriber volume and growth needs.\n\nTry out Potions with a [free sample newsletter](https://dzlivd9t4eb.typeform.com/to/kMeO3tlp). Annual plans discounts are available.\n\n### 💬 In their own words\n\n> \"I've always wanted to add a daily send option to my newsletter but every time I attempted to push these out on my own I realized I was making my work week twice as long.  \n> \n> Since getting started with Potions I'm now **sending 100% more mail (generating 200% more clicks)**, and **my list loves the new daily content.**\"\n\n![dupont.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/dupont.png)\n\n>\"I was spending 4-5+ hours weekly just to get one or two pieces of content out to reach my ICP.\n> Potions changed that.\n> They've empowered me to find my voice, and now I'm creating all my email and LinkedIn content in about 15 minutes a week! \"\n\n![donnie.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/donnie.png)\n\n\n## 2. beehiiv: Best for Media Companies\n\n[beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/), founded by early Morning Brew employees, is built for creators and media brands that want to launch, grow, and monetize their newsletters under one roof.\n\nbeehiiv is most known for its growth tools and built-in monetization features like paid subscriptions, an ad network, and referral programs. But with most newsletters I've seen with email lists large enough to use the ad network, the revenue generated is usually just enough to cover your subscription costs.\n\nThe platform's deliverability is strong, and its analytics make it easy to understand which content performs best. However, beehiiv's fast growth has also led to growing pains, particularly around support and stability for users with smaller lists.\n\n![beehiiv UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/beehiiv%20UI.png)\n\nI've had success running multiple customers' newsletters on beehiiv, but it's not without its caveats. I know a ton of people who've been kicked off the platform because beehiiv flagged their lists as \"cold.\" Although it's not malicious (beehiiv has to protect its domain reputation for its customer base), getting reinstated is extremely difficult, and the path to do it is pretty unclear.\n\nTo date, their AI writing assistant hasn't been helpful for us, and while they're rolling out API and integration features, those tools are still in the early stages, and HTML imports don't really work yet.\n\nOverall, beehiiv works well for established newsletters that already have traction, but is less forgiving for new or smaller senders with existing lists.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **3D analytics (cohort analysis)** – Track subscriber engagement and retention by cohort to identify which audience segments perform best over time.\n* **Referral program builder** – Create built-in referral systems that reward readers for bringing in new subscribers, no 3rd-party tools required.\n* **Ad network & sponsorship marketplace** – Matches newsletters with paid sponsors and ad placements directly inside beehiiv.\n* **Boosts marketplace** – Enables cross-promotion between newsletters through paid or mutual referral placements to grow audiences faster.\n* **Monetization hub** – Manage paid subscriptions, referrals, and sponsorships with no fees on revenue.\n* **Audience polls & custom forms** – Collect reader feedback and insights directly inside newsletters or web archives.\n* **Web-hosted newsletter pages** – Automatically publish newsletters to a public, SEO-friendly web archive for discoverability.\n* **Multi-newsletter management** – Allows multiple newsletters or brands under one account with separate domains, lists, and analytics.\n* **Creator network** – Connects publishers for cross-promotions, partnerships, and sponsorship opportunities within beehiiv's ecosystem.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Built-in monetization tools (subscriptions, ads, and referrals) | Limited design flexibility, no true drag-and-drop editor (custom HTML is needed for advanced layouts) |\n| Generous free plan for up to 2,500 subscribers | High risk of account suspension if lists are flagged as \"cold\"; the reinstatement process is unclear and difficult |\n| Stellar deliverability infrastructure | Monetization features rarely produce meaningful revenue until ~50K+ engaged subscribers; even successful users often just break even with subscription costs, while degrading their content with ads |\n| 3D Analytics for cohort tracking and audience insights | API and integration features are early-stage; HTML imports are unreliable |\n| Fast-evolving platform with frequent feature releases | AI writing assistant performs inconsistently and lacks professional polish |\n| | Customer support responsiveness isn't great |\n\n### Pricing\n\n![beehiiv pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/beehiiv%20pricing.png)\n\nbeehiiv offers flexible plans, starting with the free plan (up to 2,500 subscribers), which allows unlimited sends, perfect if you're testing your first newsletter and want to write it all yourself. Paid plans start at $49/month, adding advanced automation, analytics, and monetization tools.\n\nFor large or media-focused newsletters, custom enterprise plans include dedicated support and full API access.\n\nThey offer a demo, 30-day free trial, and annual discounts.\n\n### In their own words\n\n![beehiiv review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/beehiiv%20review.png)\n\n## 3. Substack: Best Free Newsletter Platform for Cultural Writing\n\n[Substack](https://substack.com) built its reputation as the home for independent writers, especially those publishing long-form essays, commentary, and cultural writing. Its minimalist interface makes it easy to write and publish newsletters or podcasts without worrying about the technical side of running a newsletter.\n\n![Substack.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Substack.png)\n\nWriters can earn by charging subscribers for access to premium newsletters or podcasts, and Substack takes a 10% cut of that revenue. It's the platform that popularized the now-famous \"1,000 true fans\" model — if 1,000 readers pay $10 a month, you can make a living as an independent writer.\n\nI live in New York, and I actually have a few friends that make a living on Substack through their \"1,000 true fans\". It sounds crazy, but it really does work (if you're a popular journalist or author).\n\nRecently, [Substack raised a 100M funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/substack-raises-100m-from-chernin-group-andreessen-horowitz-skims-ceo-and-more/) and began positioning itself as a competitor to platforms like YouTube, expanding into video and social features. Their focus is less on email now, so it's unsurprising we're seeing poor performance from prospects and clients who use Substack.\n\nSubstack's original identity was \"ad-free forever,\" but that's changing, too. The company has announced plans to introduce ads, a shift that marks a new era for the platform and could alter its long-held \"cultural writer\" vibe.\n\nI used to run my own Substack in the early days, and we still manage a few for Potions customers. It's a great space for cultural writers who care about creating long-form cultural content, not sales funnels.\n\nCompared to beehiiv's marketing-forward energy, Substack has a more editorial feel. It's more ideal for writers who really want to express their ideas on a platform with a social network element.\n\nThat said, it's not ideal for businesses running a newsletter for marketing purposes. Its analytics and customization are limited, and as Substack evolves toward social and video, it's becoming more of a media platform than a traditional newsletter tool.\n\n> TLDR; If you want to produce *original research* or thought piece content as an independent publisher, Substack is an excellent option. I probably wouldn't use it as a sales funnel though.\n\n| Pros | Cons                                                                                                                             |\n|------|------|\n| Built-in discovery through recommendations and cross-promotion | Substack takes a 10% cut of paid subscription revenue (plus Stripe fees)                                                         |\n| Simple, intuitive editor that feels like writing in a doc | Basic analytics compared to full-service marketing platforms                                                                     |\n| Free to use with unlimited subscribers | No automation tools to maintain deliverability or handle engagement sequences, which makes it not great for running a newsletter |\n| Integrated podcast and video hosting | Cleaning your list is difficult, which can hurt your deliverability over time                                                    |\n|| No custom design features, making it challenging to differentiate your brand.                                                    |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Writer-first interface** – Clean, distraction-free writing and publishing experience for essays, podcasts, and serialized content.\n* **Paid subscriptions** – Ability to charge readers for premium newsletters or podcast access.\n* **Podcast hosting** – Upload and distribute podcast episodes directly from your Substack dashboard.\n* **Video and social tools** – New features that allow creators to post videos and engage followers beyond email.\n* **Community and comments** – Built-in social layer for reader interaction and discussion.\n* **Native referral program** – Rewards subscribers for bringing in new readers and ties directly into Substack's recommendation feed for organic audience growth.\n\n### Pricing\n\nSubstack is free to start and has no subscriber limits. You only pay once you enable paid subscriptions, where Substack takes a 10% platform fee, plus Stripe's standard processing fee (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Substack Review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Substack%20Review.png)\n\n## 4. Medium: Best for Reader Experience (But on the Decline)\n\n[Medium](https://medium.com) is a clean, ad-free platform where you can publish essays, commentary, or thought pieces and reach a built-in audience of over 100 million readers. It's good for testing ideas, sharing expertise, and building visibility without managing an email list or website. Writers can join the Partner Program to earn modest revenue based on member reading time and engagement.\n\n![medium.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/medium.png)\n\nI personally use Medium and even joined the Partner Program, where I used to make a few hundred dollars per month from traffic, but those days are long gone. Which is why Medium has also been on the decline. High-quality writers used to flock to the platform for its earning potential, but now writers can [only make a small fraction](https://medium.com/@CassieKozyrkov/the-easy-path-in-social-media-is-promoting-the-worst-content-the-cheapest-tackiest-lowest-effort-stuff-be5cbf5c7a0d) of what they used to, while the platform is flooded with low-quality, spammy content.\n\nI found it helpful for experimenting with ideas. It's a great space to refine your writing or publish early thoughts before you have an established audience. But it's not where you build a business.\n\nThe platform limits your control over your readers and revenue. For example, they'll deprioritize your post if it's not paid, so you won't get as many eyeballs on your writing. Because of this, I treat it as a creative sandbox rather than a growth engine.\n\nAs for revenue, I earn about $40 a month from the paid ad network with 400 subscribers, which I'm fine with.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Ad-free platform supported by reader memberships | No ownership of audience or data |\n| Access to a large, built-in audience | Unstable algorithm and earning potential |\n| Simple publishing tools and minimal setup | Not built for scaling a brand or business |\n| | Many quality writers have left the platform since earnings have declined |\n\n### Pricing\n\nIt's free to publish. To earn, you must join the Partner Program as a paid member ($5/month). The Friend of Medium tier ($15/month) directs more financial support to your favorite writers and the Medium platform.\n\n![Medium member pricing.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Medium%20member%20pricing.PNG)\n\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Medium review.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Medium%20review.PNG)\n\n## 5. Kit: Dependable Option for Digital Sellers\n\n[Kit](https://kit.com) is a reliable, creator-focused email platform known for its simplicity and stability. It's especially popular among online educators, coaches, and creators who sell digital products, courses, or memberships. Kit offers high-level automation and tagging tools that help you deliver targeted messages based on subscriber behavior.\n\nWhile it's not as flashy as newer platforms, Kit has a long track record and remains one of the most dependable options for creators who need automations that just work.\n\n![Kit_UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Kit_UI.png)\n\nI've used Kit for multiple clients, and it's one of the more stable, affordable platforms out there. It's bootstrapped, not VC-funded, which means it's focused on sustainable growth. Kit integrates easily with Potions because their HTML importer works really well.\n\nThat said, we've fought with the tagging and segmentation system, as well as just adding subscribers to a newsletter list. When it comes to customization, changes don't get reflected quickly. The tech feels a bit dated, but it's consistent and rarely breaks, which I can't say for many tools in this space.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Built-in tools for selling digital products, courses, and memberships | Doesn't support subdomains as sender addresses |\n| Free plan for up to 10,000 subscribers | Limited design flexibility and a slow landing page editor |\n| Strong deliverability (average 99.8%) and consistently high open rates | Lacks advanced analytics like click maps and geo-tracking |\n| Bootstrapped and independently owned — no risk of sudden pivots like VC-backed platforms | Tagging and segmentation system can be confusing for new users |\n| Really strong HTML importer | |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Creator commerce tools** – Sell digital products, courses, or memberships directly through email automations.\n* **Subscriber tagging and segmentation** – Organize subscribers by behavior, interests, or purchase history for personalized campaigns.\n* **Visual automations builder** – Design automated email flows using a clear, drag-and-drop interface.\n* **Customizable forms and landing pages** – Capture leads through built-in templates (though the editor can be slow).\n* **Seamless HTML import** – Custom HTML import function works well for newsletters.\n* **Reliable deliverability** – Long-standing infrastructure with a strong sender reputation across major ESPs.\n* **24/7 email & chat support** – Access around-the-clock support for campaign, automation, and deliverability issues.\n\n### Pricing\n\n![Kit Pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Kit%20Pricing.png)\n\nKit offers a free plan for up to 10,000 subscribers, an unusually generous starting point. Paid plans start at $39/month and include advanced automations and sales features. The Creator Pro plan starts at $79/month and includes deeper insights, A/B testing, and premium support.\n\nAll plans include a 14-day free trial, annual discounts, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Kit_review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Kit_review.png)\n\n## 6. MailerLite: Best for Affordability\n\n[MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com) is a straightforward email platform built for creators, startups, and small businesses that want an affordable way to send clean, professional emails and newsletters. It's easy to learn, offers all the essentials for campaign management, and keeps the interface uncluttered.\n\nWhile it's not as feature-rich as more advanced tools, MailerLite performs reliably for businesses that prefer to manage everything themselves. It's a good fit if you're hands-on with your marketing and just need a simple way to create, send, and track emails without overpaying for complexity.\n\nI've seen MailerLite work well for smaller teams or customers who want to do everything manually. It's simple, affordable, and gets the job done, but it's severely limited in terms of customization, analytics, and automation depth. You won't get the sophistication of a platform like Kit or the growth tools of beehiiv, but for a lean budget or early-stage business, it's a great starting point.\n\n![MailerLite_UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/MailerLite_UI.png)\n\nIt's a solid contender for small businesses and solo marketers who need a reliable, budget-friendly email platform that still looks polished and performs well. You can personalize campaigns, run A/B tests, and sell digital products directly without touching code.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Easy drag-and-drop editor with clean, modern templates | Limited CRM functionality and advanced segmentation |\n| Affordable plans with transparent pricing | Not ideal for scaling or managing multiple complex newsletters |\n| Excellent deliverability and responsive customer support (4.3 stars on Trustpilot out of 2.6k reviews) | Some features (like A/B testing and advanced automations) require paid plans |\n| Simple e-commerce tools for selling digital products | Lacks deeper analytics and reporting for tracking subscriber engagement |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Clean, intuitive editor** – Drag-and-drop interface designed for quick newsletter creation without technical setup.\n* **Landing page and form builder** – Includes simple tools for collecting subscribers and promoting offers.\n* **Click maps** – See where subscribers interact with links in your newsletter.\n* **Automation workflows** – Supports basic email sequences, welcome flows, and time-based triggers.\n* **Audience segmentation** – Create dynamic segments based on subscriber behavior, location, or engagement metrics.\n* **24/7 customer support on paid plans** – Responsive live chat support.\n\n### Pricing\n\nMailerLite offers a free plan for up to 500 subscribers and 12,000 monthly emails.\n\nPaid plans start at $10/month for up to 500 subscribers and unlimited emails. An Advanced plan (from $20/month) adds multivariate testing, enhanced reporting, and priority support.\n\nAll plans include a 14-day free trial and annual discounts.\n\n![Mailerlite_pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailerlite_pricing.png)\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Mailerlite_Review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailerlite_Review.png)\n\n## 7. Constant Contact: Best for Non-Profits & Ticket Sellers\n\n[Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com) is one of the oldest email marketing platforms around. It's built for niche markets like ticket sellers and nonprofits that need an all-in-one tool to manage newsletters, announcements, and campaigns.\n\nThe platform combines email and SMS marketing, and social media posting tools under one roof. Its prebuilt templates, drag-and-drop editor, and automation options make it easy to send polished campaigns on a regular schedule.\n\nFor nonprofits, Constant Contact offers a 30% annual discount and specialized templates for donation drives, volunteer recruitment, and community events.\n\n![Constant_Contact_UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Constant_Contact_UI.png)\n\nConstant Contact also offers unique features that cater to event-based businesses, such as the ability to create, promote, and manage tickets.\n\nWhile it's reliable and supported by award-winning customer service, Constant Contact is best suited for teams that want to handle their own content and design.\n\nConstant Contact's core business is its marketing platform, but they do offer a few done-for-you add-ons to help. From what I've heard, they're known to make [customers lock in to plans](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/constantcontact.com) with no easy way to leave without talking to support.\n\nAlthough they have some add-ons, they're not known to be a creative or strategic partner. I see it as a solid, hands-on email platform — reliable, pretty user-friendly, and built to help you stay consistent, but not to guide your strategy.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Extremely beginner-friendly and easy to set up | Template customization is limited compared to design-focused tools — pixel-perfect designs may require Canva or Figma |\n| 100+ customizable templates and dynamic content blocks | Higher pricing tiers are needed to unlock advanced automation features |\n| Built-in polls, forms, and surveys to boost audience engagement | A/B testing options are basic compared to enterprise platforms |\n| Robust reporting and analytics dashboard | Can feel dated for users used to modern, minimalist ESPs |\n| 300+ integrations with third-party tools like Shopify, Salesforce, and Canva | Not ideal for teams seeking a fully done-for-you or strategic content partner |\n| Good choice if you sell tickets (like a concert venue) | Their DFY service at $535/month is far less affordable than Potions |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Event management tools** – Manage RSVPs, ticket sales, and registration directly from your email campaigns.\n* **Social media management tools** – Plan, create, and share multi-channel social media posts with one click.\n* **Donation and nonprofit templates** – Prebuilt designs for fundraising, donor updates, and volunteer recruitment.\n* **SMS marketing** – Send promotional texts, reminders, or event updates directly from your dashboard to support your email campaigns.\n* **List segmentation & tagging** – Create segments & apply tags based on subscriber data or engagement activity.\n* **Marketing automation** – Create welcome series, follow-ups, and drip sequences for new subscribers.\n* **24/7 customer support** – Live chat, email, and phone support for setup, troubleshooting, and campaign optimization.\n\n### Pricing\n\nConstant Contact offers tiered pricing based on your contact list size.\n\nPlans start at $12/month for up to 500 contacts and 5,000 emails, with higher tiers offering advanced automations and analytics, and full segmentation and reporting features.\n\nAll plans come with a free trial, and pricing scales with your contact list size. 30% annual discounts available for Nonprofits.\n\nDone-for-you services that Constant Contact offers includes:\n\n* A marketing advisor who reviews your campaigns for $60/month\n* A marketing specialist who creates 3 campaigns from your content for $250/month\n* A marketing manager who runs strategy, content, and reporting for $535/month\n* Custom email design\n\n![Constant_Contact_Pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Constant_Contact_Pricing.png)\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Constant_Contact_review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Constant_Contact_review.png)\n\n## 8. HubSpot: Best for All-In-One CRM & Marketing Automation\n\n[HubSpot's Marketing Hub](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing) is a premium, enterprise-level all-in-one marketing platform designed for teams that need to connect every email, campaign, and customer touchpoint in one place. It's powerful but pricey, better suited to established businesses with complex workflows than to smaller teams sending newsletters.\n\nThe real advantage of HubSpot is its integration capabilities. Every email is connected to its built-in CRM, so you can see precisely how each newsletter contributes to leads, sales, and customer engagement.\n\nIts automation tools, segmentation, and behavioral tracking are among the most advanced available. However, all that sophistication comes with a learning curve and significantly higher costs than most other newsletter platforms or services.\n\n![Hubspot_UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Hubspot_UI.png)\n\nIf you're willing to become so good at HubSpot that you can get a full-time job as someone who sets up and manages HubSpot for larger companies, then HubSpot can be great. But not so much, if you're looking for an intuitive tool that gives you the features you need without having to talk to sales and jump through hoops.\n\nI've worked with clients who use HubSpot, and it's one of those platforms that can do everything, but you pay dearly for it. It's great for large companies that want sales and marketing perfectly aligned, but it's overkill for most small teams or consultants. I've seen many businesses sign up for the higher tiers and use only a fraction of the features, only to be stuck paying for all those bells and whistles. I've had friends pay for their expensive Marketing Professional plan ($800/month, paid annually) to unlock basic features, only to barely use it and switch to Mailchimp.\n\nFor our customers already running their business in Hubspot's CRM, Potions integrates seamlessly, allowing us to sync data, manage campaigns, and keep everything consistent between marketing and sales.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Free plan includes a full-featured newsletter builder | Premium plans can be prohibitively expensive for smaller businesses |\n| Deep CRM integration for personalized targeting and automation | Complex setup and steep learning curve for users new to CRM platforms |\n| AI-powered tools for writing, design, and workflow automation | Onboarding fees apply to Professional and Enterprise tiers |\n| Comprehensive reporting and revenue attribution tracking | Many businesses pay for advanced tiers but use only a fraction of the features |\n| Seamless integration across marketing, sales, and service tools | Overkill for teams that only need a newsletter platform or service |\n| Potions integrates directly with HubSpot for shared clients, ensuring seamless data sync and campaign management | Core features like Campaigns are locked behind the $800/month Marketing Professional plan and Sequences require Sales Hub at $90/month/seat (you'll need to pay or commit annually) |\n| | Complex pricing that takes time to understand |\n| | You'll have to talk to sales where they'll try to upsell you |\n\n### Key Features\n\nHubSpot's Marketing Hub includes a massive suite of marketing, sales, and automation tools, which contributes to its higher price point. Below are the features relevant to email and newsletter creation, automation, and performance tracking.\n\n* **Drag & drop email builder** – Create branded newsletters using customizable content blocks within a visual editor.\n* **Email templates & personalization** – Access prebuilt templates & use CRM data for personalized subject lines, greetings, or dynamic content.\n* **CRM integration** – All email activity, sends, opens, and clicks, sync automatically to HubSpot's built-in CRM for unified tracking.\n* **Automation workflows** – Set up drip sequences, behavioral triggers, or nurture campaigns through HubSpot's visual automation builder.\n* **Enterprise-grade extras** – The Marketing Hub also includes tools for ads, chat, SEO, social, & website management, features that add power but come with a premium price tag.\n\n### Pricing\n\nHubSpot offers a free plan that includes its basic newsletter builder, CRM, and limited automation tools. However, most advanced features, like robust automation workflows, detailed analytics, and higher contact limits, require a significant upgrade.\n\nPaid plans start at $15/month/seat, but as you can see, the next tier quickly jumps into the high hundreds per month to unlock advanced capabilities.\n\nCheck out HubSpot's pricing page for full plan details. A free demo and annual discounts are also available.\n\n![Hubspot_Pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Hubspot_Pricing.png)\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Hubspot_Review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Hubspot_Review.png)\n\n## 9. Mailchimp: Most Recognizable\n\n[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) is one of the most recognized names in email marketing, initially known for its ease of use, robust automation, and broad feature set. It's often the first platform many businesses try. Mailchimp offers hundreds of templates, audience management tools, and built-in analytics.\n\n[Mailchimp_UI.webp](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailchimp_UI.webp)\n\nThat said, the platform has evolved over the years. Once known for its accessible pricing and [small-business focus](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24078896/mailchimp-subscription-price-increase-intuit), Mailchimp is now positioning itself upmarket with more enterprise features and higher costs to match.\n\nI've worked with several customers who started on Mailchimp, and it's still fine for small teams who want something recognizable and relatively easy to use. \n\nBut Mailchimp isn't as beginner-friendly as it used to be. \n\nCritically, [67% of users rate its customer support 1 star](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/mailchimp.com). Plus, its pricing is increasingly difficult to justify for smaller senders.\n\n![Mailchimp customer support.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailchimp%20customer%20support.PNG)\n\nFor simple campaigns, it works. But if you want consistent deliverability and real help, there are better options now.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Clean drag-and-drop editor with professional, modern templates | Advanced features are locked behind higher pricing tiers |\n| Extensive automation and segmentation tools | Template customization is limited compared to dedicated design tools like Canva or Figma |\n| Strong analytics, reporting, and A/B testing capabilities | Customer support has slow response times and isn't helpful |\n| Integrates with 300+ apps and e-commerce platforms | Interface has become cluttered and less intuitive for beginners |\n| | Pricing has increased as Mailchimp moves upmarket, making it less SMB-friendly |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Creative Assistant (AI design tool)** – Automatically generates on-brand graphics and templates from your uploaded assets.\n* **Journey Builder (automation)** – Create complex customer journeys triggered by subscriber activity, purchase history, or engagement.\n* **Drag & drop editor** – Create newsletters using a visual editor with customizable blocks for text, images, & buttons.\n* **Campaign benchmarking** – Compare your newsletter's performance to other Mailchimp users in your industry.\n* **Click maps** – Insight into which links and sections subscribers engage with most.\n* **E-commerce integrations** – Native connections with Shopify, WooCommerce, Salesforce, and 300+ other tools.\n\n### Pricing\n\nMailchimp offers a basic free plan for up to 1,000 subscribers and 10,000 monthly emails.\n\nPaid plans start at $13/month for 500 subscribers, adding advanced segmentation, A/B testing, and automation. The Standard plan starts at $20/month, while the Premium plan (from $350/month) unlocks advanced analytics, priority support, and unlimited audiences.\n\nAll plans include a 14-day free trial and 15% savings on annual plans.\n\n![Mailchimp_pricing.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailchimp_pricing.png)\n\n### In their own words\n\n![Mailchimp_review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Mailchimp_review.png)\n\n## 10. Moosend: Best for Affordable Marketing Automation\n\n[Moosend](https://moosend.com) is a budget-friendly email platform that delivers a good amount of functionality for its price. It's designed for small businesses that want a straightforward way to create newsletters, manage contacts, and automate email workflows without committing to an expensive platform.\n\nThe interface is clean, and the drag-and-drop editor makes it easy to create professional campaigns quickly.\n\n![Moosend UI.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/Moosend%20UI.png)\n\nYou get unlimited email sends on every plan, advanced automations even at entry-level pricing, and solid deliverability for the cost. While it lacks the polish and integrations of more premium tools, it's a reliable, low-cost option for teams who want to get started fast and don't need heavy analytics or deep CRM capabilities.\n\nMoosend works well for small senders on a budget who just want something stable and straightforward, but if an email newsletter is one of your main marketing tools or you rely on advanced workflows, you'll outgrow it pretty quickly.\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| Highly affordable pricing with access to advanced automation tools | Limited third-party integrations compared to larger platforms |\n| Intuitive drag-and-drop editor with clean, professional templates | Smaller email template library than major competitors |\n| Robust segmentation and behavioral targeting options | Customer support available only Monday–Friday |\n| Excellent deliverability performance and responsive support team | Lacks deeper CRM and eCommerce integrations |\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Drag & drop editor** – Build newsletters using customizable content blocks with no coding required.\n* **Email template library** – Choose from predesigned, mobile-responsive templates or create custom designs.\n* **Advanced segmentation** – Filter subscribers by engagement, location, or custom fields to send targeted campaigns.\n* **Automation workflows** – Design behavioral automations such as welcome emails, abandoned-cart reminders, or re-engagement sequences.\n* **Integrations & API access** – Connect Moosend with CRMs, CMSs, and analytics tools for data synchronization.\n* **List cleaning & suppression tools** – Identify inactive or invalid contacts and automatically remove them from active lists.\n\n### Pricing\n\nMoosend offers flexible pricing starting at $9/month for up to 500 subscribers, with unlimited emails and access to all core features.

You'd rather have a team, and you've got the budget to hire one.\n\nThese newsletter agencies do the heavy lifting, writing, designing, and/or growing your audience, so you can stay focused on your business.\n\n## 12. The Feed Media: Best for Large Scale Newsletter Growth\n\n[The Feed Media](https://www.thefeedmedia.com) is a high-performance growth agency built for large-scale newsletters that monetize through sponsorships, products, or B2B services. The Feed has helped major newsletters add millions of high-quality subscribers while keeping acquisition costs 20-30% lower than competitors.\n\nThey use their proprietary quality-to-cost framework to blend metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and engagement to find the most valuable audiences.\n\nFYI, they work exclusively with large-scale newsletters and don't take on small or early-stage creators. Their clients typically operate in media, B2B, or large audience businesses looking to optimize for both subscriber growth and sponsor ROI.\n\nThey focus on growth and don't write or design newsletters. The Feed is a good fit for established teams that already have strong content and monetization models in place and want to grow them at scale. If your goal is to increase reach, expand sponsorship revenue, or improve acquisition efficiency, The Feed can help you do that.\n\n### Pricing\n\nWorking with The Feed Media is by application only. Projects are limited, and pricing is discussed after approval to ensure a strong fit and measurable ROI.\n\n### In their own words\n\n![The Feed review.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/The%20Feed%20review.png)\n\n## 13.

Technical setup & ease of use\n\nSome newsletter platforms handle all the technical setup for you, while others expect you to configure DNS records, sender authentication, or custom domains yourself. If you're not tech-savvy, choose a service that makes onboarding simple or offers hands-on support.\n\n### 2. Deliverability & sender reputation\n\nEven the best newsletter won't make an impact if it lands in spam. Look for a provider with strong deliverability standards and proactive tools to protect sender reputation.\n\nSome services maintain strict IP pool policies, while others offer dedicated IPs for high-volume senders. Choose a platform that gives you visibility into whether your content meets best practices for inbox placement and engagement.\n\nDon't forget to ask if they make it easy to clean your email list to remove inactive subscribers.\n\n### 3. Design flexibility & customization\n\nPeople get a lot of emails. \n\nWhile only ~9% of consumers *say* design has an impact on their trust with a brand, the reality is that design plays a make or break role in your email's performance. \n\nSome quick, critical stats from [Nonprofit Tech](https://www.nptechforgood.com/101-best-practices/email-marketing-statistics-for-nonprofits/#:~:text=53%25%20of%20email%20is%20opened,Nonprofit%20Communications%20Trends%20Report%5D): \n\n- **53% of email is opened on mobile**—and emails not optimized for mobile get deleted in **under 3 seconds**, with **15% of users unsubscribing**.\n- Emails with **graphics** see a **1.12% higher CTR**, and adding **video** can boost clicks by **65%**. This is signficant,as CTR is typically around 2% - 2.9%.\n\nYour newsletter should reflect your brand, not look like a cookie-cutter template. Make sure the platform lets you customize layouts, colors, fonts, and sections without needing to code. Advanced tools often include drag-and-drop editors, reusable content blocks, and mobile previews so your design looks great on any device.\n\nIf design isn't your strength, consider a provider that includes professional design support or prebuilt branded templates.\n\nFinally, remember to test your email design for accessibility guidelines using a tool like [Litmus](https://litmus.com/) (or just let Potions do it for you). If you don't, your deliverability will take a hit.\n\n### 4. Scalability & pricing\n\nYour newsletter service should grow with you. Check out how pricing scales as your subscriber list expands because some charge per subscriber, while others bill by the number of emails you send.\n\nCheck for hidden costs or overage fees when you pass certain thresholds. And ask whether the service includes automation and advanced analytics at lower tiers or only at premium levels.\n\nIf you're outsourcing your newsletter entirely, make sure the pricing aligns with the value you're getting. Some done-for-you services include everything from strategy to content creation, while others just handle production.\n\n### 5. Support & subscriber growth tools\n\nA lot of email platforms are simply too cheap to have human support. \n\nGood customer support can save hours of frustration, especially when you're managing deliverability or automation. So look for platforms that provide live chat or dedicated account management rather than just an automated help center.\n\n**Newsletters are almost never \"organically viral\"**. Only [0.5% - 2%](https://agencyanalytics.com/kpi-definitions/email-forward-rate) of people will forward any of your emails*. \n\nSo, consider whether the service helps you grow your email list through your \"top of funnel\" channels. Features like signup forms, lead magnets, referral programs, and integrations with CRMs or social platforms can make list building much easier and faster.\n\n*This doesn't mean email isn't great for growth; it's just not a \"top of funnel\" action, like ads.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What are the Best Free Newsletter Services?\n\nIf you're just getting started, some of the best free newsletter services include beehiiv, Substack, and MailerLite. Each offers a free plan with basic tools for sending and growing your newsletter. Keep in mind, free plans usually limit how many subscribers or emails you can send, so they're best for testing the waters before you scale.\n\n### How Much Does it Cost to Run a Newsletter?\n\nThe cost of running a newsletter depends on how hands-on you want to be. Most DIY newsletter platforms range from $10 to $200 per month, depending on your subscriber count and feature needs. Or a done-for-you service usually costs more ($1800+). A hybrid solution, like Potions, blends automation with human expertise for a much lower monthly cost.\n\n> Most DIY newsletter platforms range from $10 to $200 per month... Potions, blends automation with human expertise starting at $199/mo.\n\n### How Much Time Does it Take to Run a Newsletter?\n\nIf you're writing and designing it yourself, plan for 3-7 hours per week to brainstorm topics, create content, design, test, and send. That doesn't include tracking performance or making improvements.\n\nDone-for-you newsletter services cut that time down to about 15-90 minutes a week, since you only need to review and approve content. But even with a DFY service, no one can read your mind, so expect to spend at least 15 minutes per week.\n\nThe more soul you put in, the better the results, but just some — even if it's not the greatest — is better than nothing.\n\n> Plan for 3-7 hours per week to brainstorm topics, create content, design, test, and send.\n\n## No More Excuses: Pick a Tool — Start Your Newsletter\n\nNewsletters remain one of the most effective ways to nurture leads, build trust, and stay top of mind. But only if you send them out consistently. Whether you prefer full control with a DIY platform or want a partner to handle everything, the right newsletter service can transform how your business communicates.\n\nIf you're ready to stop juggling content, design, and deliverability, and start sending newsletters that actually drive results without breaking the bank, Potions delivers.\n\n👉 [Get your free sample newsletter from Potions](https://dzlivd9t4eb.typeform.com/to/kMeO3tlp).

By then, most consultants have faded into the background. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nIn B2B marketing, this is often called the [\"95-5\" rule](https://www.cmoalliance.com/only-5-of-your-market-are-ready-to-buy-what-do-you-do/) - the idea is that only a single-digit fraction of your target market is ready to buy right now.\n\nThis is why a newsletter is one of the [top 3 highest ROI channels in 2025](https://www.data-mania.com/blog/b2b-marketing-roi-benchmarks-2025/) that B2B marketers use. It keeps your voice in their inbox week after week, building trust long before customers are ready to sign.\n\nMost executives making buying decisions are in their inbox way more than on platforms like LinkedIn. And you're much more likely to hit the inbox than you are the top of someone's LinkedIn feed. When done right, it bridges the gap between \"great chat\" and \"let's get started.\"\n\n> Email marketing provides a 261% ROI, with a break-even point of 7 months and a 3.5 ROAS. B2B email campaigns average a 2.4% conversion rate, slightly trailing B2C campaigns at 2.8% . - [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics)\n\nThe beauty is, you don't need to fight social algorithms or post every day.\n\nOdds are, much of your list will already know you. Maybe they've met you, heard you speak, or were referred by another client, so they'll already be more likely to open your newsletter. And you're an expert in your field, so you have a ton of unique, interesting insight for them.\n\nThat's what separates forgettable consultants from the ones that stand out in prospects' minds. And that's what we help build at [Potions](https://withpotions.com): newsletters that stay consistent, sound like you, and nurture every lead in your CRM until they're ready to hire you.\n\nUnlike most newsletters that are treated as just an educational marketing touchpoint, the newsletters we launch for consultancies are built into their GTM operations, often bringing in 5 leads every week.\n\nThe 10 steps below are my secret sauce for running successful consultant newsletters like [CIOsurge](https://ciosurge.beehiiv.com/), [AUDEO](https://withpotions.com/samples/potions-samples/audeo.html), [Content Detox](https://withpotions.com/samples/potions-samples/detox.html), and many more.\n\nThis guide is super in-depth (I made it as actionable as possible), so feel free to skip ahead depending on how advanced your newsletter marketing knowledge is:\n\n- Step 1.

Create a Plan for Your Consulting Newsletter\n\nBefore you start writing, get clear on who you're speaking to and why. This step shapes everything — your topics, tone, and what turns readers into future clients.\n\nUse these 5 questions as a guide:\n\n### Question 1: Who's your \"audience of one\"?\n\nStart by picturing your ideal client, the type of person who benefits most from your services. When you imagine your newsletter in their hands, who are they? What kind of business do they run? What keeps them up at night?\n\nAlex Lieberman, the founder of Morning Brew (probably the most successful newsletter ever), calls this your [market of one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-lieberman_who-is-your-market-of-1-every-founder-activity-7221896217335611393-QCsm/).\n\n![alexl.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/alexl.png)\n\nYou probably already know this person because they're a version of your best clients. That's your audience. Actually, forget the audience, and just picture that one person.\n\nHere's the trick: write as if you're speaking to that one person. Imagine sitting across from your ideal client. When you write to them, your message becomes sharper, more relatable, and way more genuine.\n\nMake that one reader feel understood, supported, and solve their problems. If you do that, your entire audience will feel it too.\n\n### Question 2: What problems will your newsletter solve for your audience?\n\nStart by thinking about what problems your readers are trying to solve. Your newsletter should make them feel informed, supported, and one step closer to solving the pain points they face on the daily.\n\nEvery [consulting niche](https://withpotions.com/newsletter-service-for-consultants.html) has its own version of this…\n\n- Financial consultants 👉 clients procrastinate financial planning\n- IT consultants 👉 clients face costly cybersecurity threats\n- [Legal consultants](https://withpotions.com/newsletter-service-for-lawyers.html) 👉 clients constantly risk non-compliance due to rapidly evolving regulations\n\nEach newsletter should help readers make better decisions and remind them you're the consultancy who can help.\n\n### Question 3: How will you make it unique?\n\nLet's be real: Our inboxes are flooded with emails we never read, and there's no shortage of newsletters. Substack alone has [75k+ newsletters](https://medium.com/practice-in-public/ive-analyzed-75k-substack-newsletters-and-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-to-succeed-in-2025-f429fe040535) (and that's just one platform).\n\nBefore I launch a new newsletter, I look at what similar newsletters currently exist, and I note:\n\n1. Why I think those newsletters are successful\n2. What I think could be improved\n3. What they're missing\n\nThis will help guide your newsletter's unique positioning in the market, just like you'd approach launching any product. Yes, you should think of your newsletter as a product.\n\nYour perspective and in-the-trenches insights make your newsletter unique. So, share your frameworks, lessons from client projects, turn the topics that regularly come up on client calls into content, and put your own spin on industry news to shape your audience's perspective.\n\n> Your newsletter is a **product**. It needs to solve a problem, and be differentiated. \n\nPresent problems you know you can solve in an exaggerated way to grab your reader's attention and flex your expertise. A great example is [Farmer's Insurance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3qFdXDZ8Cw0?si=Kd1AM4qslsJKz2iU) ads. They turned their most outrageous claims into commercials with the slogan, \"We know a thing or two, because we've seen a thing or two.\" They're showing proof of their expertise with unforgettable wild claims.\n\nYou could even feature some of your clients in a Q&A section to address topics you run into regularly, if that would interest your audience. Spotlighting your current clients is another cool way to use your newsletter.\n\n### Question 4: What content does your audience like?\n\nNot sure what content your audience likes most? Look at what's already working.\n\nInternally, review your LinkedIn posts, client presentations, or Q&As that get people talking. Repurpose those ideas into short, focused newsletter segments.\n\n![Evan Kozliner spying on influencers on linkedin.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Evan%20Kozliner%20spying%20on%20influencers%20on%20linkedin.png)\n\nExternally, study content from other industry influencers that your market of one loves. You can literally visit your dream client's LinkedIn (or other social account) to see what posts they Like or engage with.\n\nThen, note what topics, themes, and styles resonate most with them. Lean into those patterns.\n\n### Question 5: How often will the newsletter go out?\n\nFor most consultants, weekly or bi-weekly is the sweet spot. But frequency is pretty industry-specific. If you're in a fast-paced industry with rapid change, like tech, weekly is probably the minimum, but in a slower-moving field, like accounting, you could send less often.\n\nWhat matters more than frequency is consistency. Whether you send weekly, biweekly, or monthly, stick to a schedule you can maintain.\n\nOnce your audience expects to hear from you, your newsletter will become a part of their regular routine.\n\n## Step 2. Choose the Right Newsletter Service\n\nThere are literally dozens (if not hundreds) of [newsletter platforms](https://beehiiv.com/blog/best-newsletter-platforms) on the market, each with its own unique features, integrations, support, and pricing structure.\n\nThe platform you choose needs to grow with you, support your unique needs, and be easy to use. Don't let choosing the wrong platform be the reason you give up on running your newsletter.\n\n### What kind of platform do you need?\n\nStart by being honest about how hands-on you want to be. If you have the time and enjoy writing, traditional newsletter platforms like Mailchimp make it easy to design, schedule, and send your newsletter on your own.\n\n**Beware:** Don't make the mistake of choosing one of the most popular options, like beehiiv or Substack, just because you see a lot of other newsletter operators using them. The problem with platforms like these is that they're designed for creators — not for businesses with high-value lead lists — so you'll be left out to dry when it comes to integrating with your current tech stack or even support (they typically prioritize users with big lists).\n\nOn the other hand, if you know you need a newsletter, but can't be bothered to learn every nitty-gritty technical detail of running one, a done-for-you service like [Potions](https://withpotions.com/newsletter-platform.html) gives you both: the platform AND the team to run your newsletter almost ENTIRELY for you, at a steal of a deal.\n\n![done for you consulants.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/done%20for%20you%20consulants.png)\n\nPotions handles your newsletter end-to-end — content, design, list cleaning, sending, and growing subscribers — so you can stay dialed in on client work.\n\nEach newsletter positions you as a thought leader in your space, and we'll let you know who's reading and clicking so you can follow up and strike (reach out) while the iron's (lead's) hot.\n\n### What features matter most?\n\nDon't get distracted by flashy dashboards or extra tools you'll never use (*cough cough* Hubspot). The best newsletter platform is the one that makes sending simple, reliable, and seamlessly integrates into your business.\n\nAt the bare minimum, your platform should make it easy to:\n\n- Keep your email list clean by filtering out undeliverable or inactive subscribers\n- Customize your newsletter template\n- See analytics down to individual subscribers\n- Connect to your workflows and tech stack\n- Scale as your list size grows without drastic price jumps\n- Provide accessible and knowledgeable support for when you run into technical issues (a lot of platforms have subpar support for users with small lists)\n\n## Step 3: Plan Your Content Layout\n\nWhen we launch a new newsletter, we help our clients choose the type of content they want to include and plan the layout that every issue will follow. This usually includes several repeatable sections for different types of content.\n\nYour consulting newsletter should be made up of content sections that your market-of-one cares about and will find interesting. This could include:\n\n- Stories\n- Tips (e.g., at the end of your take on a news story, give your readers an actionable takeaway they can use)\n- Case studies\n- Lessons learned\n- Industry news with your personal take\n- Tools or other resources worth sharing\n- Memes (everybody loves a good meme)\n\nMix it up to give readers value and variety. Remember, you want your content to be interesting, you don't want to regurgitate the same information every other consultant in your industry talks about all the time. And if it is a hot topic everyone's talking about, think of ways to make your presentation original.\n\n> Your readers should know what to expect from you each email. The easiest way to do that is by having a couple of repeated sections. \n> \n> We often recommend between 2 - 4 sections, but lots of newsletters do well with a simple single idea drip.\n\n## Step 4: Design Your Newsletter Template\n\nOnce you've decided on your content sections and where they'll appear in your newsletter layout, it's time to design your template.\n\nDesign can be the difference between \"okay\" marketing and GREAT marketing.\n\nDesign makes your newsletter stand out and helps it become recognizable as yours. But it's worth noting that some email clients can't handle heavy design in emails. For example, in Outlook, background images don't load. So, you need to check where your market of one is receiving emails before you choose your design elements.\n\nWith Gmail, you can be more creative, but if your newsletter is going to Outlook inboxes, you'll need to be more conservative to make sure it looks like it's supposed to. If you'll be sending to Outlook inboxes [This article](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/how-to-code-emails-for-outlook/?utm_source=Inbox_Collective&mc_cid=7ed412393a&mc_eid=0cbe21a0ac) goes more in-depth on this.\n\n![Potions Blueprint.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Potions%20Blueprint.PNG)\n\nSome basic design rules to follow:\n\n- Keep your design elements simple and easy to read on all devices and screen sizes.\n- Pick colors that match your brand and won't make the content harder to read (especially for the visually impaired).\n- Stick to one or two [fonts that are supported by most devices and apps](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/insights/best-email-fonts). \n- Stay away from extremely generic design\n- Don't ignore highly simple design either! A newsletter that \"looks\" like a personal email can often be best.\n\nMost of our customers use banners at the top of their newsletter template for a more branded feel.\n\nA banner should be simple, maybe your newsletter title with a quick value prop or slogan. Try to keep it slim in height, so people don't have to scroll much to reach the content. For desktop users, [650-700 pixels wide and 90-200 pixels tall works well](https://beefree.io/hub/html-email-creation/email-banner-size). For mobile users, the best banner is 350 pixels wide and up to 100 pixels tall.\n\nYou can also use dividers to break up sections and make it more skimmable.\n\nFor our customers who don't have access to designers, we have our designers create on-brand design elements, which is a pretty unique feature our clients love.\n\nAlways keep your file sizes lean for banners, dividers, or other images. Compress your images with a tool like [Kraken](https://kraken.io/web-interface) and limit their width to 600px, since that's pretty much the limit in email.\n\nSome people go overboard with huge images that take forever to load. If you use Potions, don't worry, we'll always catch that.\n\n**Note:** Emails over [102KB](https://mailchimp.com/help/gmail-is-clipping-my-email/) are more likely to be filtered as spam or cut off in the middle, forcing readers to click again to read the full version (if they figure that out). This limit includes everything in your email: Words, images, links, HTML tables & dividers, Inline styles & CSS, tracking code, and hidden preview text. As a rule of thumb, aim for roughly 1,200 or less words per issue so it's long enough to be valuable but short enough to not exceed the email file size limit, especially if you add image files (each character in a plain text email typically takes up [1 byte of data](https://mailmeteor.com/tools/email-size)).\n\n![Message clipped.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Message%20clipped.PNG)\n\n## Step 5: Nail Down Your Brand's Voice and Tone\n\nBefore you write, imagine your market of one. The best newsletters read like a conversation with one person. When your writing sounds human and familiar, readers start seeing you as someone they know and trust faster.\n\n### Voice and tone\n\nYour voice is your personality. It's how you sound in everything you create, and it doesn't change. To find it, reread messages you've sent to clients. Notice your phrasing, humor, and pacing.\n\nNotice how your clients speak too, and mirror their language where it makes sense.\n\nWhen you draft your newsletter, read it out loud. If it sounds like something you'd actually say to that client across the table, you're there.\n\nYour tone, on the other hand, can shift depending on what you're writing about. A strategy consultant might sound direct and analytical, while a creative consultant might be more playful or curious.\n\nMost of our consulting clients use a confident, insightful tone that's conversational. Some might go with a more authoritative tone, like CIOsurge (geared toward technology leaders).\n\n![ciosurge.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/ciosurge.png)\n\nAnother Potions customer, Anthony Miller's newsletter AUDEO, sounds like it was written directly to his audience, with a confident, conversational tone.\n\n![AUDEO tone.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/AUDEO%20tone.png)\n\n## Step 6: Set Up Email Workflows To Support Your Newsletter\n\nYour newsletter shouldn't live like a solitary floating head in cyberspace. A few simple workflows can help you welcome new readers, re-engage quiet ones, and keep your audience warm.\n\n### Launch Email: Announcement to existing contacts\n\nThe highest-performing e-commerce email is the abandoned cart, with a [44.1% open rate and 29.9%](https://www.dynamicyield.com/article/abandoned-cart-emails/#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20abandoned%20cart,window%20to%20win%20them%20back.) of those resulting in a recovered sale. Newsletters are the \"abandoned cart\" email for consultants, but for some reason, most don't send them.\n\nWhen your discovery calls don't result in a new client, you can use your newsletter as a way to follow up.\n\nAnd before chasing down new subscribers, send a quick announcement to the people already in your world. Let them know you're launching a newsletter and invite them to join. Keep it short and conversational, something like:\n\n\"I'll be sharing short insights every Thursday that help you [insert benefit]. Want in?\"\n\nIt reframes your newsletter as a free resource instead of a pitch they feel forced to subscribe to.\n\n> Newsletters are the \"abandoned cart\" email for consultants, but for some reason, most don't send them.\n\n### Welcome email\n\nWhen someone new signs up, they should immediately get a friendly note explaining what to expect and when.\n\nYour welcome email should reintroduce who you help, what kind of insights they'll receive, and link to one or two of your best posts.\n\nEnd it with a CTA to check out a free resource, book a strategy session, or reply to the email with a question or thought. This kills two birds with one stone: 1) It acts as a potential sales touch point if a lead is in-market to buy, and 2) It increases the likelihood future emails will land in the main inbox if they engage.\n\nB2B Saas Reviews' welcome email is a great example.\n\n![b2bnl.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/b2bnl.png)\n\nYou don't need a long drip sequence here. One well-written welcome email is enough to build context and trust. However, if you have evergreen content, it can be worth doing a drip sequence before introducing people to your newsletter to build credibility. For example, I know a cold email consultant who has amazing drip sequences for cold emailing. They're really high-value content, and they're evergreen, so he doesn't really have to change them.\n\n### Re-engage or remove email\n\nPlan for list hygiene. If someone hasn't opened your newsletter in a while, send a polite check-in asking if they still want to stay on the list. If they don't respond, remove them. This will improve your overall engagement rates and decrease your chance of being flagged as spam by email providers.\n\nYou're goal is to get replies with this email. \n\nSometimes open and click data isn't accurate because some email providers block tracking. This can cause you to need to send a breakup email, even if the subscriber *has* in fact been reading (you can't tell if they were!).\n\nSee how Stu McLaren's email asks for a reply in order to keep getting his emails.\n\n![break up email.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/break%20up%20email.png)\n\n## Step 7: Build & Grow a High-Value Newsletter Subscriber List\n\nA valuable newsletter list is built on relevance over quantity. Small, engaged lists outperform a massive, unengaged one every time.\n\nSome of the best-performing newsletters I've seen started with fewer than 100 people because they were engaged and hyper-relevant.\n\nThe smaller the list, the easier it is to build relationships, and as a consultant, you know relationships are what converts clients.\n\n### Drip your marketing, sales, and outbound leads into your newsletter list\n\nThe easiest way to jumpstart your newsletter with a high-value list is to import the leads you already have. These could be old marketing leads in your CRM who downloaded lead magnets, or old sales leads you want to stay top-of-mind with. Just be sure you use an email verification tool to remove old emails that won't deliver (B2B lists tend to decay [3.6%](https://www.landbase.com/blog/data-decay-rate-statistics) every month).\n\nThat stat alone is another reason to start your consulting newsletter. Sending a newsletter consistently protects your list. If you haven't emailed a contact in 12 months, it's really back to being a cold email. A newsletter keeps your email list warm.\n\nAfter a new lead books a discovery call, build a simple automation that adds contacts from your Calendly, Zapier, CRM, or outbound sequences straight into your newsletter list (with consent, of course).\n\nIf you don't use an ESP integration with Calendly, you can edit the content of your email confirmations or follow-up emails via Calendly's \"Workflows\" feature to include a CTA and a link to your newsletter signup page.\n\n![Calendly automation.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Calendly%20automation.png)\n\nYou can also make it part of your outreach by including a CTA at the end of your messages, something like, \"Would you like to get insights like this in our newsletter?\" (with a link).\n\nOnce you've done this, move on to intentional list-building.\n\n> B2B lists tend to decay 3.6% every month. And, if you haven't seen to a contact for over 12 months, they become effectively \"cold\", making it harder to reach them in the future.\n> \n> The true value of a newsletter is the sum of the sales pipeline you kept warm.\n\n### Create lead magnets that attract subscribers you'd want for consulting clients\n\nThe best way to grow your list is to offer something worth trading an email for. Think small, specific, and useful lead magnet ideas — something that solves a real problem your ideal clients face.\n\nWhen they access it, you want them thinking, \"If this is what they give away for free, imagine what working with them is like.\"\n\nDepending on your industry and offerings, you could create:\n\n- **Ebooks** – Offer a focused, high-value resource that answers a recurring client question. This financial planning firm offers a free ebook in exchange for your email.\n\n![retirement.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/retirement.png)\n\n**Free trainings** – Host a short, actionable session that highlights your expertise. This estate planning law firm uses free webinars to build its email list.\n\n![free trainings.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/free%20trainings.png)\n\n**Industry reports** – Summarize data to help your clients and add your analysis. For example, Jason Staats helps accounting firms become more profitable. He created this free report comparing 14 different practice management platforms.\n\n**Free tools** – Build simple calculators, templates, or AI-powered workflows that make your audience's job easier. This consulting firm helps independent consultants make more money and offers a free consulting rate calculator in exchange for subscribing to their newsletter.\n\n![free tools.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/free%20tools.png)\n\n**Workflows or checklists** – Turn your internal processes into plug-and-play assets. This marketing consulting firm offers a list of marketing audit questions it uses in its own workflows.\n\n**Dynamic quizzes** – Use a short quiz to help readers diagnose pain points. [Perspective](https://www.perspective.co/) or [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) is an excellent platform for quizzes. This leadership development consulting firm offers a free quiz to identify your leadership style.\n\n![quizzes.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/quizzes.png)\n\n**Free strategy sessions** – Offer a short consultation to start real conversations with qualified leads. Para Consulting, a business systems consulting firm, offers a free system audit.\n\n![free workflowers.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/free%20workflowers.png)\n\n\n### Meet your audience where they are\n\nPromote your resources in the spaces your clients hang out. For most consultants, this will be LinkedIn. Add your newsletter and lead magnet CTAs to your top-performing posts. Add opt-ins to your blog, YouTube videos, or presentations. If you speak at events, make your newsletter the natural \"next step\" CTA.\n\nYou can also cross-promote with other consultants or creators in your space. This could be with another influencer who has a newsletter with a similar audience, OR you could collaborate on a piece of content with them to promote in your newsletter (with the goal that they share it with their audience too).\n\nAnd if the numbers make sense, test paid campaigns to accelerate growth. Don't be fooled by the [$1-$2 cost per subscriber](https://inboxcollective.com/what-i-wish-id-known-before-spending-5000-promoting-newsletters-through-meta/#:~:text=I%27ve%20been%20able%20to,%242%20in%20more%20competitive%20markets.) folks get on consumer newsletters; you're going to pay a lot more for readers that are decision makers (often in the 10s of dollars per acquisition, depending on your market).\n\nIf you don't want to deal with learning ads, you can use a service like Potions to help set up ads and bring in subscribers who fit your client profile.\n\n### Be mindful about growth\n\nTry to add contacts who've had a positive interaction with your brand (like a discovery call or lead magnet) as long as you give them a clear, easy way to opt out and respect any prior unsubscribes. This will help protect you from fines from the [CAN-SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business).\n\nIf you're new to email marketing: Deliverability refers to the ability of your emails to land in your recipient's primary inbox (not the spam or promotions folder). The lower the engagement that your emails get, the less likely you'll land in the right inbox in the future.\n\nSo, start small when sending your newsletter, especially when you haven't sent that many mass emails before. Gradually add contacts (if you're importing a list), and focus on engagement.\n\nA clean, permission-based list will protect your sender reputation and make sure your newsletters land in the inbox, not spam.\n\n> Start small when sending your newsletter, especially when you haven't sent that many mass emails before.\n\n## Step 8: Create a Content Strategy That Proves Your Expertise\n\nYour newsletter is both a touchpoint and proof that you know your stuff. Each issue should remind readers why you're the trusted choice in your field by sharing insights they can actually use.\n\n### Start with client pain points\n\nThink about what your clients struggle with every day. What questions come up on repeat? What blind spots do you see again and again? That's your content gold. Use it to show you understand their world better than anyone else.\n\nFor Content Detox, our customer [Jacob Statler's newsletter](https://withpotions.com/blog/stat-digital-case-study.html) for B2B content marketers, he focuses on stories around evolving algorithms and actionable tactics to get more customers from content.\n\nKeep it practical. Share short frameworks, lessons from client projects, or quick wins your readers can apply right away. Bite-sized insights are easy to digest, and they reinforce your authority with each issue.\n\n![Content Detox stories curated for market of one.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Content%20Detox%20stories%20curated%20for%20market%20of%20one.PNG)\n\n### Mix original and curated content\n\nYou don't have to create new content from scratch every week. Repurpose what you already have:\n\n- LinkedIn posts could be quick tips\n- Blog posts can be deep dives (but keep in mind, most long-form SEO blog posts are too long for inboxes, so you'll need to summarize and adapt)\n- Case studies and client calls could be short stories\n- A podcast or video could be summed up with the top takeaways\n\nDon't currently have content? You can easily curate content from around your industry, but make it your own. Share relevant industry news or trends, and layer in your perspective. Think of it as curation with context. You're filtering what matters and explaining why it matters.\n\nIn addition to curating top industry news stories, we like to make it as effortless as possible for our busy consultant customers with four ways to make original newsletter content:\n\n1. Chat with our AI and we'll create content based on the transcript\n2. Add a voice note talking about your content idea\n3. Add a URL of content you want to use with your personal context\n4. Upload text or documents to be repurposed\n\n![Potions original content.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Potions%20original%20content.png)\n\nThen, our [AI and writing team](https://withpotions.com/) turns those insights into an actionable story that sounds exactly like them.\n\n\n![approve_potions.gif](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/best-newsletter-services/approve_potions.gif)\n\n### Feature others to build connection\n\nDon't make your newsletter a one-way street. Feature a client quote, a partner's insight, or a quick Q&A with another expert. It keeps your content fresh and organically grows your network.\n\nIncluding features of others in your industry also acts as a [content-based networking](https://www.sweetfishmedia.com/blog/what-is-content-based-networking) play. It helps you get your foot in the door with leads or referral partners.\n\n![Content Detox Content Based Networking examples.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/Content%20Detox%20Content%20Based%20Networking%20examples.png)\n\nAlthough featuring them in a story shouldn't be an invite to pitch your services, it's a great way to start a relationship by providing value.\n\n### End with a natural next step\n\nClose each issue with a clear, conversational CTA. Invite readers to book a call, reply with a question, or check out a resource. It should feel like continuing the conversation, not a pitch.\n\nTry to avoid phrases like \"free\" or \"for a limited time\", especially in the beginning of your newsletter journey. As your domain earns more trust with the ISPs (e.g. Gmail) you can sprinkle that stuff in. But you don't want to come out of the gate getting classified as a cold emailer.\n\nI like how our client newsletter, [The Augmented Leader](https://augmentedleader.withpotions.com/), ends with 2 CTAs: the first is an option to get started, the second provides more information for those not quite ready to jump in.\n\n![thanks for reading.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/thanks%20for%20reading.png)\n\nWhen you first launch your newsletter, limit your CTAs and focus more on engagement and building relationships. Once you're sending consistently, you can start sprinkling in CTAs.\n\nA lot of people don't know this, but linking out to domains with low domain reputation can hurt your deliverability, so if your website is new, that's another reason to limit your CTAs in the beginning.\n\nA lot of consultants plug a \"book a meeting\" type CTA at the end of their newsletters. Pretty forgettable, right? This easy-to-ignore status quo is actually an opportunity for you to stand out by dressing up your CTA to be perceived as high-value and low-risk as possible.\n\nA much better CTA would be something like (if you were a marketing consultant): \"Get a free audit to find 7 ways to unlock instant revenue from your existing traffic — without spending more on ads.\"\n\nI like to dress up boring CTAs following one of these frameworks from Sabry Subi:\n\n1. X ways to achieve [desirable thing] without doing [undesirable thing]\n2. Do [difficult thing] in [specific time period] even if [shortcomings]\n3. Achieve [desirable thing] like [an expert] even without [something expected]\n4. How to eliminate [problem] without doing [the thing they hate] within [specific time period]\n\nThese are actually headline frameworks, but I like to repurpose them for CTAs.\n\n## Step 9: Stay Consistent & Optimize Over Time\n\nThe #1 way newsletters fail? Giving up after a few sends, after not getting the desired results.\n\nDirect conversions – like booking a meeting with a lead – will come if you follow each step in this guide. But you need to consistently monitor your KPIs, test new ideas, and know what you need to improve based on each KPI.\n\n**Note:** Before you analyze the metrics that could directly impact your pipeline, make sure you're not shooting yourself in the foot with poor deliverability. Your deliverability rate should stay around 99% or better. If your bounce rate rises above 2%, it could be a sign that you're emailing undeliverable addresses or your content is triggering spam filters.\n\n### Top newsletter KPIs you need to track:\n\n| KPI | Meaning & How to Improve |\n|-----|---------------------------|\n| **Email List Size** | The number of leads you have in your newsletter funnel.<br><br>• Add new and old leads from your CRM<br>• Add newsletter CTAs to your website, social posts, blog, and other content<br>• Run paid ads |\n| **Spam Complaints** | You're emailing people you shouldn't, or they hate your content 😬.<br><br>• Remove inactive contacts<br>• Verify that the contacts you add want emails from you |\n| **Unsubscribes** | Leads aren't interested in your newsletter.<br><br>• Reevaluate the value and subject of your content<br>• A healthy unsubscribe rate (after you've been sending for 3+ months and pruning your list) is around 0.1%. |\n| **Open Rate** (Industry and list-size-dependent. For consultants, aim for 30–40%) | Leads are interested in your subject line or newsletter.<br><br>• Make sure your emails land in the main inbox<br>• Tweak your subject lines to focus on what your audience wants<br>• If this is < 14%, you're in spam |\n| **Link Clicks** | Leads are engaged with the content inside.<br><br>• Add more links to related resources<br>• Make links more prominent with size, color, anchor text, or buttons<br>• Make CTAs more compelling<br><br>*Caveat:* The best newsletters don't rely solely on linking out to content; they focus on getting people to read the newsletter itself. Too many outbound links make for noisy CTR.<br><br>Email clients cache emails, and many people check email with limited connectivity, so your email needs to be self-sufficient. |\n| **Replies** | Your newsletter is good (or bad) enough for leads to take the time to comment.<br><br>• Ask your audience more questions (especially in the intro)<br>• Add CTAs that require a reply |\n| **Meetings Booked** | Your CTA and offer resonate with your leads' pain.<br><br>• Don't try to track attribution directly, most leads will read your newsletter, then visit your site directly or Google you<br>• Ask leads how they found you and if they read your newsletter<br>• Test different offers and placements<br>• Revamp your CTA copy<br>• Make your offer more valuable |\n\n\nAttributing meetings booked can be a bit tricky, but there are a few ways you can measure impact:\n\n1. Add UTM codes to your links and CTAs to track via Google Analytics or your CRM (ex: ?utm_source=newsletter)\n2. Ask new prospects why they booked (and how they found you) on the discovery call\n\nThen, you'll want to make sure your newsletter-influenced leads are tracked in your CRM's sales pipeline.\n\n## Step 10: Turn Engagement Into Consulting Clients\n\nLook for subscribers who consistently interact with your newsletter. These readers are most likely to reply to an outreach message.\n\nWhen you spot one of these subscribers, send a short message that's relevant to how they're engaging:\n\n| Engagement Type | Outreach Message Example |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Frequently Opens | Hey [Name], noticed you've been following the newsletter lately. Anything specific you're working on that I can help with? |\n| Link Clicks (Be aware: Spam detectors and bot clicks can make this metric noisy. Potions filters this for you) | Hey [Name], did you hear about [news story topic of the link they clicked on]? Curious to hear how you're adapting. |\n| Replies | Sounds like this is something you're thinking about internally. Want to hop on a quick call to dig into it? |\n\nThese messages work because they feel natural and not salesy, just a genuine check-in.\n\nBy the way, if you're worried about sounding creepy about knowing how often they engage with your newsletter, you don't actually need to call that out.\n\nWith our Potions customers, we turn this into an ongoing workflow. Every month, we generate reports of the most-engaged leads enriched with roles, company intel, and more.\n\nThis gives whoever's running sales a shortlist of leads to prioritize.\n\n![Lead list from Potions.PNG](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/Lead%20list%20from%20Potions.PNG)\n\nRemember, the goal is to stay visible until the timing lines up. When it does, you'll genuinely be providing value to a lead who likely needs your help – not spamming them – so don't be shy.\n\n## Let Potions Handle Your Consulting Newsletter For You\n\nMost consultants want to stay visible, but time is their enemy. Between client calls, deliverables, and everything else on your plate, marketing your own business always gets pushed \"later.\"\n\nThat's why we built Potions.\n\n[Potions](https://withpotions.com) is made for consultants who know the value of staying in touch but don't have the time to write, curate content, and manage a weekly newsletter. We plan, write, design, and send your newsletter so you can stay focused on client work and know it's going out right on schedule.\n\n![how it works.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/how-consultants-can-get-clients-with-newsletters/how%20it%20works.png)\n\nYou share your insights and ideas, and we do the rest. Every issue sounds like you, looks professional, and lands in the main inbox.\n\nAND you get all of this at one-tenth the cost of hiring an agency to run a similar service for you.\n\nReady to launch your consulting newsletter without burning out?

        "content": "When Jacob Statler, founder of [Stat Digital](https://statdigital.io/), found us, he had a challenge many marketing agency owners can relate to:\n\nJacob crushed marketing for clients but couldn't find time to market his own agency. He was WELL aware of the irony.\n\n> \"I'd spend all week creating quality content for clients. Then Friday would come around, and I'd tell myself I'd start my own newsletter next week. That went on for a year.\"\n\n8 months since starting with Potions, that story looks completely different.\n\nWith Potions, Jacob launched **Content Detox**, a weekly newsletter that now reaches 650+ subscribers, saves him 30+ hours a month, and consistently fuels new client conversations and project expansions.\n\nThe best part? Stat Digital is now nurturing every lead that's ever been in the pipeline — without adding extra workload. Here's how it happened.\n\n## Client Snapshot\n\n| | |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Client** | Stat Digital |\n| **Industry** | B2B Marketing Agency |\n\n### Key Results\n\n| Metric | Result            |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Subscribers | 650+              |\n| Weekly LinkedIn readers | 140+              |\n| Hours saved per month | 30+               |\n| Client contract expansions | ✓ (5-figure ARRs) |\n| Average open rate | 40.9%             |\n\n## The Story of an Agency Marketer Who Struggled with Consistency for His Own Marketing\n\nStat Digital helps early-stage B2B SaaS companies build predictable growth through exceptional content and SEO. But like so many service-based founders, Jacob's own marketing always fell to the bottom of the list.\n\nHe mainly relied on posting 3 to 5 times a week on LinkedIn, a strategy that built visibility but consumed 8+ hours every week and was subject to the whims of the algorithm gods.\n\nMeanwhile, promising leads in his CRM sat idle.\n\n> \"I'd have great sales calls, and then months would go by before I followed up. Those relationships went cold, that's thousands of dollars left on the table.\"\n\nCreating a newsletter was an obvious need, but that meant an extra 6-8 hours a week if he did all the research, writing, and designing, and also handled delivery himself.\n\n### The Cost of DIY\n\nBefore finding Potions, Jacob was considering shelling out roughly $1,000 a month to pay for this newsletter stack:\n\n| Item | Monthly Cost |\n|------|--------------|\n| Freelance writer | $869 |\n| beehiiv | $49 |\n| Zapier | $29.99 |\n| **Total** | **$947.99** |\n\nAnd even then, he'd have to edit everything to really make it his own.\n\n\"Just use AI\" wasn't the answer either.\n\n> \"Even though ChatGPT would save me time writing, I was still left to stitch together the entire newsletter process by myself. Every. Single. Week.\"\n\nThis means thing like:\n* Segmenting his list (and sunsetting old subscribers)\n* Building re-engagement campaigns, welcome emails, and launch campaigns\n* Testing the design across email clients\n* Researching the news sources he actually trusts (and not just whatever garbage sources ChatGPT would cite)\n\nJacob needed a newsletter system that kept his tone and strategy intact, without draining his time and energy.\n\n## Why a Marketing Agency Made a No-Brainer Decision to Choose Potions\n\nWhen Jacob found Potions while researching AI startups, he immediately understood what made us different.\n\n> \"Potions wasn't another platform like Mailchimp or beehiiv. It actually ran your newsletter for you.\"\n\nThat distinction was key. Our done-for-you model meant he could hand over setup, deliverability, and writing, all while maintaining full creative control and for a fraction of the cost of hiring a team.\n\n> \"It was a total no-brainer. Potions eliminated everything I didn't want to deal with — setup, deliverability, content creation, all of it.\"\n\n![Statler Website](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/Content%20Detox%20Content%20Based%20Networking%20examples.png)\n\n2 weeks later, **Content Detox** was live (see a sample of it on our [samples page](https://withpotions.com/samples.html)).\n\n## The Always-On Newsletter That Effortlessly Saves 30+ Hours Every Month\n\nWe kicked off the launch of Content Detox by interviewing Jacob to capture his voice and ideal audience. From there, we built a custom newsletter template that looked and read like Stat Digital: smart, witty, and strategic.\n\n> \"It was really impressive how quickly they got things moving. The whole process runs like a sewing machine.\"\n\nEach week, our AI and team curate stories relevant to B2B marketers, draft the issue, and send it to Jacob for approval. He spends just **30 minutes** adding his expert insights to Potions and another **45 minutes** putting his unique touch on each newsletter. A far cry from the 6-8 hours it would take on his own.\n\nThat's a savings of **26-35 hours every month**, almost a full workweek to focus on clients and growing his own agency.\n\n> \"Potions doesn't just save time. It gives me peace of mind knowing my audience hears from me every week, even during my busiest client weeks.\"\n\nWe also connect directly with Jacob via Slack for fast collaboration, sharing link ideas, feedback, and scheduling updates in real time.\n\n## From Sporadic Posts to a Scalable Content Engine that Fuels Pipeline\n\n8 months after launch, the Content Detox newsletter has become one of Stat Digital's most reliable marketing channels, producing measurable growth and consistent engagement.\n\nLeads and clients now mention the newsletter on calls. Old leads re-engage on their own. And existing clients have expanded their own scope of work after reading the newsletter.\n\n> \"It's been nice to have something consistent that goes out every week. People I've talked to before will reply or comment on something from the newsletter, and that keeps me in the conversation.\"\n\n### 8 Months After Launching Content Detox:\n\n| Metric | Result                                 |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|\n| Average open rate | 40.9%                                  |\n| Subscribers | 650+ and growing                       |\n| Weekly LinkedIn readers | 140+                                   |\n| Hours saved monthly | 30+                                    |\n| Revenue impact | Expanded 5-figure ARR client contracts |\n\n![8 Month Results](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/8_month_results.png)\n\n### Content Repurposing Flywheel\n\nEach edition fuels Jacob's broader content flywheel. He repurposes sections of Content Detox into LinkedIn posts, in about 10 minutes, keeping his feed active and relevant without adding more to his schedule.\n\n> \"It's nice that I can reuse parts of it. It helps me show up more often without feeling like I have to constantly come up with something new.\"\n\nJacob also leverages Content Detox as a content-based networking play, where he interviews industry experts and features their insights as the main story.\n\n![Content Detox Sample.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/Content%20Detox%20Sample.png)\n\nThis has become a way to \n\n1) Grow subscribers.\n2) Build connections that could turn into referral sources or future clients.\n\n## The Unexpected Impact: From Stress to Strategy\n\nBeyond the metrics, Jacob gained something even more valuable: a sense of ease and control that transformed his marketing from a source of stress into a system that works.\n\nEven experienced marketers struggle to find time for their own marketing.\n\n> \"Before Potions, I was on a hamster wheel trying to stay consistent on social and follow up with leads. Now, my marketing runs on autopilot.\"\n\nThat shift, from guilt to calm, became one of his biggest wins. The impact of reclaiming headspace caught Jacob by surprise.\n\nNow, instead of scrambling to write posts, he knows a polished newsletter will reach his audience every week, whether he's heads-down on client work or out of the office.\n\n> \"It's the first time I've been able to treat my own agency like one of my clients. That's the biggest change.\"\n\nPotions flipped what used to be a nagging to-do into a strategic system that compounds over time, serving as an always-on channel for credibility, thought leadership, and new business.\n\n## Jacob's Advice for Those Considering Potions\n\n**Potions is a low-risk, low-cost, high-value investment** compared to DIY-ing it or hiring a team.\n\nTraditional newsletter platforms still leave you managing content, design, and deliverability on your own, which requires hours of work. And we all know, time is money.\n\nWith Potions, most of the work is done for you. Even if you're like Jacob, who proudly admits he's extra picky about content quality, he only spends less than an hour fine-tuning each issue.\n\nIt's a cost-effective, hassle-free way to launch a professional newsletter without adding to your workload.\n\n![Content Detox Sample.png](https://withpotions.com/blog/assets/stat-digital-case-study/bot.png)\n\n## Ready To Finally Launch Your Newsletter?\n\nAt Potions, our goal is to make it effortless to stay top-of-mind with all the neglected leads in your CRM.
